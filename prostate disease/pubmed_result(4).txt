Prostate cancer is a genetically complex disease with multiple predisposing
factors affecting presentation, progression, and outcome. Epidemiologic studies
have long shown an aggregation of breast and prostate cancer in some families.
More recently, studies have reported an apparent excess of prostate cancer cases 
among BRCA2 mutation-carrying families. Additionally, population-based screens of
early-onset prostate cancer patients have suggested that the prevalence of
deleterious BRCA2 mutations in this group is 1% to 2%, imparting a significantly 
increased risk of the disease compared with noncarrier cases. However, studies of
high-risk prostate cancer families suggest that BRCA2 plays at most a minimal
role in these individuals, highlighting the potential genetic heterogeneity of
the disease. In this commentary, we review the current literature and hypotheses 
surrounding the relationship between BRCA2 mutations and susceptibility to
prostate cancer and speculate on the potential for involvement of additional
genes.
