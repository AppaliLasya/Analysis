Structural alterations in the entire coding regions (exons 1 to 27) of the
retinoblastoma (RB) gene in primary human prostate cancers were investigated,
using polymerase chain reaction and single strand conformational polymorphism
analysis of RNA. Of 25 samples obtained from patients, four (16.4%) were found to
have RB alterations. DNA sequencing of the PCR products revealed point mutations 
resulting in single amino-acid substitutions of exons 6 and 19 in two cases, and 
base deletions of exons 8 and 17 in two cases. Two of four cases with RB
mutations were moderately differentiated localized tumors and other two with RB
mutations were poorly differentiated tumors with metastases. Our results suggest 
that RB gene mutation is involved in progression steps of prostate
carcinogenesis.
