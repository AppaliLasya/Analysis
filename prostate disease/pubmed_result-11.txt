A study was made of the incidence of p53 mutations in Japanese males with
prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Polymerase chain reaction
single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was used as a primary
screening technique with gene sequencing being carried out in positive cases. Two
out of 21 prostate cancers (9.5%) were found to have p53 mutations. These were
stage B2 and D2 prostate cancers. No abnormalities were found in the remaining
cases or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Mutations of the p53 gene would thus
appear infrequent in the tumourigenesis of primary prostate cancer.
