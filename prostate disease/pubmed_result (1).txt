Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease. The majority of breast cancer
cases (about 70 percent) are considered sporadic. Familial breast cancer (about
30 percent of patients), often seen in families with a high incidence of BC, has 
been associated with a number of high-, moderate-, and low-penetrance
susceptibility genes. Family linkage studies have identified high-penetrance
genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN and TP53, that are responsible for inherited syndromes.
Moreover, a combination of family-based and population-based approaches indicated
that genes involved in DNA repair, such as CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1 (FANCJ), PALB2
(FANCN) and RAD51C (FANCO), are associated with moderate BC risk. Genome wide
association studies (GWAS) in BC revealed a number of common low penetrance
alleles associated with a slightly increased or decreased risk of BC. Currently, 
only high penetrance genes are used in clinical practice on a wide scale. Due to 
the development of next generation sequencing technologies, it is envisaged that 
all familial breast cancer genes will be included in the genetic test. However,
additional research in clinical management of moderate and low-risk variants is
needed before full implementation of multi-gene panel testing into clinical
work-flows. In this review, we focus on the different components of familial
breast cancer risk.
