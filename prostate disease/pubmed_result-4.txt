P53 is a tumor suppressor gene that has been implicated in the molecular genetics
of many human malignancies. Nucleotide alterations, most commonly single point
mutations, have been shown not only to abrogate the p53 suppressor function but
also to contribute to the transformed phenotype. We report the detection of a p53
gene mutation in clinical specimens of a patient with relapsing prostate
adenocarcinoma 14 years after definitive external beam radiation. The techniques 
of single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of
polymerase chain reaction generated products were used for this study. Analysis
of tissue from different locations of the primary tumor revealed intratumoral
molecular heterogeneity; the mutation was absent in 1 area but present in
another. Tumor from a regional lymph node metastasis harbored the identical p53
mutation. Furthermore, an additional genetic alteration, an allelic loss on
chromosome 17p but not including the p53 gene, was observed only in the
metastatic tissue. These observations in clinical specimens of primary and
metastatic sites provide evidence for the association of the p53 gene in the
progression of human prostate carcinoma.
