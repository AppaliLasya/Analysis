Cytokines are reported to be associated with the formation of prostate cancer.
Our aim was to investigate whether C/T polymorphisms of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) 
gene and IL-2 receptor beta (IL-2RB) gene are associated with prostate cancer. We
compared the frequency of the polymorphisms of the IL-2 gene and the IL-2RB gene 
between 96 patients with prostate cancer and 105 healthy male volunteers from the
same area (age >60 years). They were followed for at least 5 years. There was a
significant difference in distribution of the genotype of the IL-2 gene
polymorphism between the prostate cancer group and the control group (P = 0.017).
The distribution of the TT homozygote of the IL-2 gene was significantly higher
in the cancer group (32.3%) than in the control group (16.2%). However, no
significant statistical difference was found between the polymorphism of the IL-2
gene and prostate cancer in survival analysis during a 5-year follow up period
(log rank test; P = 0.19). There was no significant difference in the
distribution of the genotype of the IL-2RB gene polymorphism between controls and
cancer patients (P = 0.388). This study suggests that the IL-2 gene may be
associated with susceptibility to prostate cancer in the Taiwan population.
