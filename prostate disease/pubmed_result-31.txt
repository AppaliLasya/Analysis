PURPOSE: To investigate whether NM23 (nm23-H1, nm23-H2), a metastasis suppressor 
gene family, is a molecular marker indicative of metastatic potential of
localized carcinoma of the prostate (CaP). Previously, we found decreased nm23-H2
expression correlated with an increase in stage, and here we have expanded the
cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty prostate tissue samples from patients with CaP and 
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were examined by quantitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for NM23 gene expression.
Samples were grouped according to stage, grade and whether the patient received
combined androgen blockade (CAB) prior to surgery.
RESULTS: We could not confirm our initial results of an inverse correlation of
nm23-H2 expression levels with grade. However, two significant results were found
after CAB: 1) nm23-H1 expression was reduced (p = 0.003), and 2) nm23-H2
expression across stage and grade was uniformly higher (p = 0.003) than in
untreated samples.
CONCLUSION: NM23 appears not to be a useful molecular marker of metastatic
potential in CaP. The altered gene expression after CAB may relate to a cancer
cell subpopulation insensitive to apoptosis induced by hormone withdrawal.
