The retinoblastoma (RB) tumour suppressor gene has been associated not only with 
retinoblastoma but also with several other tumours like osteosarcoma, small cell 
lung carcinoma and prostate and breast cancer. We have studied the incidence of
RB gene alterations in 96 primary breast tumours using Southern blotting
techniques. The outcome has been related with patient and tumour characteristics,
oncogene amplifications, p53 mutations and prognosis. RB gene alterations were
found to occur more frequently in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive than in
ER-negative tumours and less frequently in tumours with oncogene amplification
than in tumours without oncogene amplification of HER2/neu, c-myc or 11q13. RB
gene alteration was observed in tumours both with and without a p53 gene
mutation. Data on 87 patients (mean age, 59.6 years; median follow-up, 108
months) and RB gene alterations revealed a significant association between the
frequency of RB gene alterations and node-negative patients (p < 0.01) or smaller
(< 2 cm) tumours (p < 0.01), but no relation with age, differentiation grade or
(relapse-free) survival. Patients with and without RB gene alterations showed the
same relapse-free and overall survival.
