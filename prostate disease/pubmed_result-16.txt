MAD and MXI1, two recently described members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
gene family, encode proteins that dimerize with and modulate the DNA binding of
max. In turn, mad-max or mxi1-max heterodimers or max homodimers can compete for 
DNA binding sites with dimers formed between max and myc oncoproteins and
antagonize the transcriptional activities of this latter class of proteins. Using
a combination of somatic cell mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization
techniques, we have determined the chromosomal locations of the MAD and MXI1
genes. The MAD gene maps to chromosome 2p12-p13, a region involved in
translocations and deletions in acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias as well
as non-lymphocytic leukemias and Hodgkin disease. The MXI1 gene localizes to
chromosome 10q24-q25, a region involved in translocations and deletions in acute 
and chronic lymphocytic leukemias and prostatic carcinomas. The availability of
genomic clones of MAD and MXI1 will permit an assessment of their involvement in 
these diseases at the molecular level.
