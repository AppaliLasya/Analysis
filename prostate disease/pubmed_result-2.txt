Point mutations at codons 12, 13, or 61 of the Ha-, Ki-, and N-ras genes are able
to convert these normal cellular genes into activated oncogenes. Previous studies
have shown that ras gene mutations occur in a variety of human solid tumors and
may be important in the pathogenesis of some of these tumors. In order to test
the hypothesis that ras gene mutations may be associated with prostate cancer, we
have used an oligodeoxynucleotide hybridization assay to detect wild-type and
mutant alleles in genomic DNA from prostate tumors and prostate tumor cell lines 
amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-four primary prostate
tumors (23 acinar tumors and one ductal tumor) and five prostate tumor cell lines
were examined for mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61 of the Ki-ras, Ha-ras, and
N-ras genes. Two mutations were detected: an A----G transition causing a
glutamine to arginine amino acid substitution at codon 61 of the Ha-ras gene in a
primary prostatic duct adenocarcinoma and a G----T transversion causing a glycine
to valine amino acid substitution at codon 12 of the Ha-ras gene in a prostate
tumor cell line (TSU-PR1) derived from a lymph node metastasis. While the overall
frequency of ras gene mutations in prostate tumors is low, when these mutations
do occur they may have a role in the progression of disease or the development of
the unusual ductal variant of prostatic adenocarcinoma.
