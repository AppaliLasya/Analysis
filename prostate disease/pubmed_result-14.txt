Alterations in the p53 gene have been described in a variety of human malignant
neoplasms. We have examined 29 stage B prostate carcinomas for alterations in the
p53 gene and for amplification of the MDM-2 gene. No evidence of mutations in the
conserved exons 5 to 8 was found by polymerase chain reaction single-stranded
conformation polymorphism analysis and no accumulation of p53 protein was found
by immunohistochemistry. However, loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus was
observed in 11% of information cases. Amplification of the MDM-2 gene was not
observed by Southern blot hybridization. In contrast, stage C and D prostate
carcinomas showed accumulation of p53 protein in 33 to 66% of cases. We conclude 
that alterations in p53 function are infrequent in clinically localized prostate 
cancers but are more common in advanced cancers.
