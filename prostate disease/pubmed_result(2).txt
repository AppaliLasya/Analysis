One of the most investigated low-penetrance genes is the androgen receptor gene. 
A recent meta-analysis showed however that the absolute difference in number of
repeats between cases and controls was less than one repeat. This result has
questioned whether the androgen receptor gene could be functionally important in 
prostate cancer etiology. The authors hypothesize that genes that are downstream 
from the androgen receptor gene, potentially those involved in testosterone
response, could be of more interest. One of the primary responses of prostate
cells to testosterone is the production of polyamines. Recently, a meta-analysis 
across gene-expression profiling studies found that genes in the polyamine
biosynthesis pathway appear to be consistently dysregulated in prostate cancer.
Polyamines are also involved in prostate diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the 
authors suggest that future oncologic research to identify candidate regions for 
prostate cancer should focus on genes dysregulated in this pathway.
