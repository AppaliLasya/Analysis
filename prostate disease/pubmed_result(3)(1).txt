Prostate tumor initiation and progression to malignancy may involve upregulation 
of the androgen receptor known to stimulate prostate cell proliferation; other
etiologic mechanisms may include dysfunction of the apoptotic pathway but also
deregulation in signal transduction and control of the cell cycle in prostate
tissue; such abnormalities could arise from overexpression or mutations in a
number of oncogenes or down-regulation by inactivating mutations, allelic loss,
or other epigenetic mechanisms in tumor suppressor genes. The advantages and
drawbacks of various delivery systems (retroviral, adenoviral, liposomes) used
for human gene therapy are being considered. Several ex vivo and in vivo as well 
as cell culture studies are suggested for the therapy of the human prostate
cancer using transfer and expression of genes that might be implicated in
prostate carcinogenesis especially of the tumor suppressor p53. Expression of
suicidal genes in prostate cancer cells using prostate-specific promoter and
enhancer elements as well as targeting of the androgen receptor or the
insulin-like growth factor genes with triplex technology in prostate cancer cells
and their metastases, is expected to be of therapeutic value.
