Mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor gene are among the most common genetic
alterations in human cancers. In the present study we analysed the mutations in
the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in 25 primary and 20 metastatic human prostate
cancer specimens. DNA extracted from the paraffin-embedded sections was amplified
by hot-start polymerase chain reaction, and p53 gene mutations in the conserved
mid-region (exons 4-9) were examined using single-strand conformation
polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and immunohistochemistry. In the present study, we
used a novel hot-start PCR-SSCP technique using DNA Taq polymerase antibody,
which eliminates primer-dimers and non-specific products. Because of this new
technique, the results of PCR-SSCP showed very high resolution. Polymerase chain 
reaction products were sequenced directly for point mutations for the p53 gene.
Mutations were found in 2 out of 25 primary prostate cancers (8%) and 4 out of 20
metastatic cancers (20%). Mutations were observed exclusively in exon 7 and not
in exons 4, 5, 6, 8 or 9. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein, determined by
immunohistochemistry, correlated with the degree of metastasis in prostatic
cancer.
