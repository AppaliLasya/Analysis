Detection of point mutations in the Dunning System with the Ki-ras2 gene in the
first and second positions of codon 12 exon I, has been performed using
allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) primers. PCR generated 94bp templates and
genomic DNA extracted from the Dunning cell lines AT-1, AT-3, Mat-Lu, and
Mat-Lylu were tested. Our investigation revealed that the first and second
positions of codon 12 have undergone either transitions or transversions from the
wild type sequence (GG). Dorsal prostate (DP) solid tissues used as controls
revealed the wild type configuration as well as transversions at both positions, 
in addition to a transition in the first position for Mat-Lu. The most aberrant
of the Dunning lines (AT-3 and Mat-LyLu) collectively displayed sequence changes 
(transitions and transversions) with no evidence of the wild type configuration. 
These findings are supportive of biometric studies (area, shape factor, and
motility) along with adhesion and invasion assays done in our laboratory in
correlating genotypic and phenotypic properties to metastatic potential.
