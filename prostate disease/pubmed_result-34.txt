BACKGROUND: Homeobox genes encode transcription factors involved in the genetic
control of normal development and differentiation, as well as in malignant
transformation. To begin to assess the possible role of homeobox genes in
prostatic cell carcinogenesis, we surveyed initially for expression of
homeobox-containing genes in the TSU-PR1 cell line.
METHODS: This was performed by RT-PCR using degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotide
primers to the homeobox-binding sequence to generate partial cDNAs which were
cloned and sequenced.
RESULTS: Using this method, expression of 14 members of homeobox-containing genes
were detected in TSU-PR1 cells. All of these expressed genes correspond to
previously identified homeobox genes located within the HOXA, B, C, and D
clusters. We further examined the expression of these homeobox genes in different
human prostatic cell lines by using whole cDNA slot blot and Northern blot
analysis. One of the sequences corresponding to the human GBX2 homeobox gene is
overexpressed in TSU-PR1, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 metastatic prostate cell lines
relative to the normal prostate.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the homeobox gene GBX2 may participate in
metastatic progression in prostatic cancer.
