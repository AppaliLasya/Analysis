Prostate cancer is a disease with heterogeneity of multiple gene transcriptomes
and biological signaling pathways involved in tumor development. The prostate
transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1 (PMEPA1), a multifunctional protein
played critical roles in prostate tumorigenesis. The pleiotropic nature of PMEPA1
in modulating androgen and TGF-β signaling as well as splice variants mechanisms 
for functional regulations of cancer-associated genes prompted us to investigate 
the biological roles of PMEPA1 isoforms in prostate cancer. In addition to 4
reported PMEPA1 isoforms (a, b, c and d), one novel isoform PMEPA1-e was
identified with RNA Seq analysis of hormone responsive VCaP, LNCaP cells and
human prostate cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We
analyzed the structures, expressions, biological functions and clinical relevance
of PMEPA1-e isoform and less characterized isoforms c and d in the context of
prostate cancer and AR/TGF-β signaling. The expression of PMEPA1-e was induced by
androgen and AR. In contrast, PMEPA1-d was responsive to TGF-β and inhibited
TGF-β signaling. Both PMEPA1-d and PMPEA1-e promoted the growth of androgen
independent prostate cancer cells. Although PMEPA1-c was responsive to TGF-β, it 
was found to have no impacts on cell growth and androgen/TGF-β signaling. The
TCGA data analysis from 499 patients showed higher expression ratios of PMEAP1-b 
versus -d or -e strongly associated with enhanced Gleason score. Taken together, 
our findings first time defined the prostate tumorigenesis mediated by PMEPA1-d
and -e isoforms, providing novel insights into the new strategies for prognostic 
evaluation and therapeutics of prostate tumor.
