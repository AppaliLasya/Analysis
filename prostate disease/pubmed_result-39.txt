BACKGROUND: Little is known about the genetic events in the malignant
transformation of prostatic cells. This is due in large measure to the cellular
heterogeneity of the prostate.
METHODS: An amplification method was devised to synthesize cDNA from small
samples of cancer and benign tissues of the same resected glands. Differential
gene expression of candidate informative markers between cancer and benign was
screened by the polymerase chain reaction with gene-specific oligonucleotide
primers.
RESULTS: The expression of a transcription factor, ETS-2, was shown to be
elevated in some cancer specimens. Elevated expression was also noted for
neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and another transcription factor, SEF2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method can be used to identify quickly genes that are
differentially expressed between benign and cancerous prostate cells.
Transcription factors, such as ETS-2, may play a significant role in cancer
progression.
