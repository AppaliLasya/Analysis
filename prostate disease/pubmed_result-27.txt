The p53 gene is known to be one of the frequently altered tumor suppressor genes,
involved in the oncogenesis of a wide spectrum of human malignant tumors. We
investigated mutational events of the p53 gene in 18 clinically untreated
prostate cancers. Direct sequencing analysis demonstrated that 1 of 18 cases
harbored point mutation in the highly conserved transcript region. The case
showed CAT at codon 273 instead of wild-type CGT, substituting the encoded amino 
acid form histidine to arginine. The case had previously revealed homozygous loci
on 17p, including the p53 locus, by restriction fragment length polymorphism
analysis. The other 17 cases harbored neither mutation nor small deletion. It is 
concluded that point mutation of the p53 gene is a infrequent event in the
oncogenesis of untreated prostate cancer.
