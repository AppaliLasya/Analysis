BACKGROUND: Metastatic prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death
in men. The rate of response to androgen ablation is high, but most patients
relapse as a result of the outgrowth of androgen-independent tumor cells. The
androgen receptor, which binds testosterone and stimulates the transcription of
androgen-responsive genes, regulates the growth of prostate cells. We analyzed
the androgen-receptor genes from samples of metastatic androgen-independent
prostate cancers to determine whether mutations in the gene have a role in
androgen independence.
METHODS: Complementary DNA was synthesized from metastatic prostate cancers in 10
patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer, and the expression of the
androgen-receptor gene was estimated by amplification with the polymerase chain
reaction. Exons B through H of the gene were cloned, and mutations were
identified by DNA sequencing. The functional effects of the mutations were
assessed in cells transfected with mutant genes.
RESULTS: All androgen-independent tumors expressed high levels of
androgen-receptor gene transcripts, relative to the levels expressed by an
androgen-independent prostate-cancer cell line (LNCaP). Point mutations in the
androgen-receptor gene were identified in metastatic cells from 5 of the 10
patients examined. One mutation was in the same codon as the mutation found
previously in the androgen-independent prostate-cancer cell line. The mutations
were not detected in the primary tumors from of the two patients. Functional
studies of two of the mutant androgen receptors demonstrated that they could be
activated by progesterone and estrogen.
CONCLUSIONS: Most metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancers express high
levels of androgen-receptor gene transcripts. Mutations in androgen-receptor
genes are not uncommon and may provide a selective growth advantage after
androgen ablation.
