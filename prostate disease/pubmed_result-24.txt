Elevated dihydrotestosterone levels have been suggested to increase the risk of
prostate cancer. The human SRD5A2 gene encodes the type II steroid 5
alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone to the more bioactive compound
dihydrotestosterone. We have determined the distribution of a dinucleotide repeat
in low-risk Asian-Americans, high-risk African-Americans, and intermediate-risk
non-Hispanic Whites. We found this marker to be more polymorphic than previously 
reported, with some alleles being specific to African-Americans. Genetic variants
of the SRD5A2 gene may play a role in predisposition to prostate cancer and in
explaining the substantial racial/ethnic variability in risk.
