PURPOSE: A newly recognized class of INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors CDKIs) include its prototype, p16 (INK4A/MTS1/CDKN2), and three
others, p15 (INK4B/MTS2), p18 (INK4C), and p19 (INK4D). The putative tumor
suppressor gene, p16 is frequently altered in certain neoplasms and many cell
lines. The potential role of INK4 CDKIs in pathogenesis of prostate carcinoma was
studied.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two primary prostate cancer samples and two
prostate cancer cell lines were examined for alterations of the p16, p15, p18,
and p19 genes by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation
polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and Southern blot analysis.
RESULTS: Alteration of the p16 gene was found in one of 32 primary prostate
cancer samples by PCR-SSCP. DNA sequencing of the sample showed a 24-basepair
insertion in exon 1 of the p16 gene at codon 11. No other mutations were found in
p15, p18, or p19 genes by PCR-SSCP. Furthermore, none of the p16, p15, p18, or
p19 genes had alterations by Southern blot analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that structural abnormalities of the INK4
CDKIs is a rare event in prostate carcinoma, and the loss of function of INK4
CDKIs by other mechanisms, such as methylation should be further explored.
