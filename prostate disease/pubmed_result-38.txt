BACKGROUND: The p16 gene product is a negative regulator of cell cycle and has
been shown to be deleted or mutated in a number of tumor cell lines and primary
tumors. The role of p16 in prostate cancer is not defined. Prostate cancer
tissues and cell lines were evaluated for p16 gene alterations.
METHODS: Five metastatic prostate cancer cell lines were analyzed for p16 gene
structure and its expression by Southern and Northern blot analyses. Forty-one
DNA specimens from 18 microdissected primary tumor specimens, adjacent normal
tissues, and cell lines were amplified by polymerase chain reaction for p16
protein coding and splice junction sequences. Mutations were analyzed by single
strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: DU 145 cell line exhibited a missense mutation in codon 84 (GAC to TAC).
With the exception of previously reported polymorphism, no mutation was detected 
in p16 coding or splice junction sequences in primary prostate cancer specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of p16 gene by mutations in the protein coding sequence
does not play a major role in the genesis of primary prostate cancer.
