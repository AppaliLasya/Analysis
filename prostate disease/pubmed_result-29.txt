Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in aged men. Although ras and p53 gene 
mutations have been detected in some prostate cancers, the major genetic
alterations involved in its carcinogenesis are not well understood. Mutation of
the APC gene is responsible for colorectal tumors in which ras and p53 mutations 
are also often involved. Using PCR-SSCP analysis and sequencing, we examined 31
human primary prostate cancers (three cases at stage A, 10 at stage B, five at
stage C and 13 at stage D) and four cases of lymph node metastasis from the stage
D cases, for mutations in the APC gene. A mutation was detected in only one of
the 35 samples (3%). This mutation, present in a primary stage B cancer, had a T 
to C transition in exon 15 at the first position of codon 956, resulting in
substitution of histidine for tyrosine. This study clarified that APC gene
mutations are not largely involved in the development of clinical prostate
cancer.
