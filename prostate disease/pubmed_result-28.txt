BACKGROUND: Lack of well-defined relevant in vivo or in vitro tumor models is one
of the major limitations in assessing candidate therapeutic regimens, especially 
gene therapy, for prostate cancer. Since gene therapy is emerging as a
potentially powerful therapeutic modality, it is desirable to evaluate this
approach for the treatment of human prostate cancer.
PURPOSE: We sought to establish a relevant ex vivo tumor model for gene therapy
studies of human prostate cancer.
METHODS: We constructed and established a transgenic human tumor model consisting
of three major components: 1) human primary prostate cancer cells, CWR22,
reactivated for growth after storage in liquid nitrogen; 2) a collagen gel ex
vivo tissue culture system useful for short-term maintenance and manipulation of 
CWR22 cells under in vitro experimental conditions; and 3) a high-velocity,
particle-mediated gene transfer system that is highly efficient in the ex vivo
transfection of target cells. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the cell 
culture media were monitored after transfecting CWR22 cells with candidate
therapeutic genes, including the cytokines human interleukin 2 (IL-2) and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), both as complementary 
DNAs [cDNAs]). CWR22 cells, transfected with firefly luciferase cDNA as a
reporter gene, served as control cells for cytokine gene expression. CWR22 cells,
transfected with the bacterial beta-galactosidase cDNA as a reporter gene, were
used to assess the efficiency of gene transfer. Transcription of each of the
cDNAs was driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early gene promoter.
RESULTS: The three-dimensional organization of tumor cells and functional
characteristics of human prostate cancers were maintained in this ex vivo model
of prostate cancer. Candidate therapeutic genes, CMV-IL-2 and CMV-GM-CSF, were
expressed at peak levels of up to 38 ng of protein per 10(6) cells every 24
hours. IL-2 and GM-CSF secretion was sustained at approximately 40%-50% of peak
levels during the entire experimental period (9-10 days in culture). At 7 days
after gene delivery, a more than twofold reduction in the secretion of PSA was
detected in the IL-2 (3.8 +/- 1.3 ng/10(4) cells every 24 hours [mean +/-
standard deviation]) or GM-CSF (4.0 +/- 1.7 ng/10(4) cells every 24 hours) cDNA
transfected cells as compared with the control cells transfected with luciferase 
cDNA (9.3 +/- 1.0 ng/10(4) cells every 24 hours). Up to 10% of the cells
transfected with beta-galactosidase cDNA expressed measurable beta-galactosidase 
activity.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an efficient, rapid, and reliable system for 
gene transfer and expression in primary human prostatic carcinoma cells
maintained in a collagen gel culture system.
IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest a broad application of this CWR22 xenograft
primary culture system as an ex vivo tumor model for the evaluation and
characterization of various candidate therapeutic genes for human prostate cancer
gene therapy, including a cytokine gene-modified tumor vaccine strategy.
