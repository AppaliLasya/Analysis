INTRODUCTION: To investigate the association of 1G/2G polymorphism in matrix
metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) promoter with susceptibility to prostate carcinoma in
the Turkish population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MMP-1 promoter polymorphism was genotyped by PCR-RFLP
analysis in 55 prostate cancer patients and 43 healthy controls.
RESULTS: The frequency of 1G/2G genotypes in prostate cancer patients was similar
to that of the controls (all p values were >0.05). Compared with the 1G/1G
genotype, neither the 2G/2G nor a combination with the 1G/2G genotype
significantly modified the risk of developing prostate cancer and metastasis
status. In addition, the frequencies of genotypes were not significantly
different among patients stratified by smoking status and family history of
prostate cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2G allele of the MMP-1 promoter polymorphism might not modify
the risk of prostate cancer development and might not be used as a putative
marker to predict the potential of metastasis in this cancer type, at least in
the Turkish population.
