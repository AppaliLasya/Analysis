A gene from human chromosome 11p11.2 was isolated and was shown to suppress
metastasis when introduced into rat AT6.1 prostate cancer cells. Expression of
this gene, designated KAI1, was reduced in human cell lines derived from
metastatic prostate tumors. KAI1 specifies a protein of 267 amino acids, with
four hydrophobic and presumably transmembrane domains and one large extracellular
hydrophilic domain with three potential N-glycosylation sites. KAI1 is
evolutionarily conserved, is expressed in many human tissues, and encodes a
member of a structurally distinct family of leukocyte surface glycoproteins.
Decreased expression of this gene may be involved in the malignant progression of
prostate and other cancers.
