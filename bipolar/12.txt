We have previously performed a genome scan in 22 multiplex pedigrees with bipolar
disorder and detected a moderate linkage signal on distal portion of chromosome
14q22-32. One of the large pedigrees displayed a parametric lod score >3 at a
marker on 14q23-32. Upon inspection of genes located in this region revealed
AKT1, a kinase that activates a lithium-responsive cell-survival pathway. Because
lithium is an effective mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder patients, AKT1 is an
interesting candidate for further investigation. We screened the gene for
possible mutations and detected 14 polymorphisms. Seven polymorphic sites were
clustered in a small segment spanning exon 14 and downstream intron. Transmission
of haplotypes constructed from this cluster showed a weak evidence of association
between the AKT1 and bipolar disorder.
