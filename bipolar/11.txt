Two recently described adjacent DNA polymorphisms [(GT)12-18 and (CT)4-5] in the 
5'-regulatory region of 5-HT2C receptor gene were analysed in a sample of 88
bipolar patients and 162 controls, all of Spanish origin. Statistical analyses
revealed no overall allele or genotype associations with the disease. A haplotype
analyses between the (GT)12-18/(CT)4-5 motif and a Cys23Ser variant of the 5-HT2C
gene (which had previously been genotyped in the same sample) showed similar
distributions between cases and controls. Only a slight increase of s-Ser23
haplotype was found in the subgroup of bipolar women with family history of
psychiatric illness (OR=1.24 [95%CI: 1.12-1.38]).
