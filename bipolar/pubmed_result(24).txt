INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder is characterized by severe mood symptoms including
major depressive and manic episodes. During manic episodes, many patients show
cognitive dysfunction. Dopamine and glutamate are important for cognitive
processing, thus the COMT and DAOA genes that modulate the expression of these
neurotransmitters are of interest for studies of cognitive function.
METHODOLOGY: Focusing on the most severe episode of mania, a factor was found
with the combined symptoms of talkativeness, distractibility, and thought
disorder, considered a cognitive manic symptoms (CMS) factor. 488 patients were
genotyped, out of which 373 (76%) had talkativeness, 269 (55%) distractibility,
and 372 (76%) thought disorder. 215 (44%) patients were positive for all three
symptoms, thus showing CMS (Table 1). As population controls, 1,044 anonymous
blood donors (ABD) were used. Case-case and case-control design models were used 
to investigate genetic associations between cognitive manic symptoms in bipolar 1
disorder and SNPs in the COMT and DAOA genes. [Table: see text].
RESULTS: The finding of this study was that cognitive manic symptoms in patients 
with bipolar 1 disorder was associated with genetic variants in the DAOA and COMT
genes. Nominal association for DAOA SNPs and COMT SNPs to cognitive symptoms
factor in bipolar 1 disorder was found in both allelic (Table 2) and haplotypic
(Table 3) analyses. Genotypic association analyses also supported our findings.
However, only one association, when CMS patients were compared to ABD controls,
survived correction for multiple testing by max (T) permutation. Data also
suggested interaction between SNPs rs2391191 in DAOA and rs5993883 in COMT in the
case-control model. [Table: see text] [Table: see text].
CONCLUSION: Identifying genes associated with cognitive functioning has clinical 
implications for assessment of prognosis and progression. Our finding are
consistent with other studies showing genetic associations between the COMT and
DAOA genes and impaired cognition both in psychiatric disorders and in the
general population.
