Since its introduction into the statistical genetics literature, the transmission
disequilibrium test (TDT) has seen widespread use in analyses of linkage and
association due not only to its simplicity but also to its desirable properties
relative to other within-family analytic methods. In this paper, we describe an
extension to the TDT useful for examining genetic heterogeneity. This extension
uses contingency table analyses such as log-linear analysis to test for
differences in linkage disequilibrium across levels of one or more moderator
variables. We applied these analyses to test for linkage disequilibrium between
the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) and bipolar disorder, as well as for genetic
heterogeneity due to sex, diagnostic breadth, and study site. Using data from two
studies (the UCSD/UBC and Cardiff data sets), we found evidence suggesting
linkage disequilibrium between DAT1 and bipolar disorder, as well as
heterogeneity due to diagnostic breadth and study site.
