Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heterogeneous and heritable psychiatric
illness. Age at onset has been shown to be a powerful tool for dissecting both
the phenotypic and genetic complexity of BD. In this article, we present findings
from an association study between the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism and age at onset,
showing that both alleles and genotypes at this locus associate with early onset 
BD.
