We investigated a possible association between dysbindin gene (DTNBP1) variants
and bipolar I disorder (BID). Five SNPs within DTNBP1 (rs3213207, rs1011313,
rs2005976, rs760761, and rs2619522) were genotyped for 151 patients with BID and 
478 controls. We observed a significant protective association of the haplotype
A-C-G-T-A (all SNPs, P = 0.00016) and particularly G-T-A (the last three SNP, P =
0.00007) within DTNBP1 variants investigated. Single marker and subgroup (e.g.,
psychotic features, age at onset, family history, etc.) analyses showed no
significant association. Although the association was due to a small number of
subjects, specific DTNBP1 haplotypes, previously associated with schizophrenia,
may be also associated with BID. Adequately powered studies from different
ethnicities will be necessary to confirm our findings.
