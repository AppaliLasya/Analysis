Two intronic polymorphisms of the human alpha subunit of the olfactory G-protein 
(G(olf)) are described. They were detected with single-stranded conformational
polymorphism (SSCP) methods and confirmed by sequencing both strands. These
single base pair (bp) substitutions occur in introns 3 (an A/G at 35 bp 3' from
the exon 3/intron 3 5' splice site) and 10 (an T/G at 7 bp 5' from the 3' splice 
site). Both polymorphisms are relatively common, with minor allele frequencies of
31% (intron 3) and 16% (intron 10). The intron 3 variant shows no linkage
disequilibrium with an intron 5 (CA)n microsatellite located approximately 50 kb 
3' from the intron 3 variant, among a small group of German individuals with
schizophrenia. The intron 3 variant is interesting because it may create an
'in-frame' cryptic splice site which, if activated, would add 12 residues to exon
3. The intron 10 variant is interesting because a purine is substituted for a
pyrimidine in the 'polypyrimidine' tract of the 3' splice site, a single base
substitution of the type which has been associated with aberrant splicing in the 
androgen receptor gene.
