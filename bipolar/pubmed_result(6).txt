Many studies have indicated that the norepinephrine transporter (NET) may play an
important role in the mechanisms underlying affective disorders. Thus, the genes 
of the NET (SLC6A2) are good candidates for research on bipolar disorder (BPD).
This study examined whether the NET gene is a susceptibility factor for the BPD
in Han Chinese. A promoter -182 T/C polymorphism (rs 2242446) and the exonic
polymorphism 1287 G/A (rs 5569) of the NET gene were analysed using a polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR)-based method in 261 BPD patients and 245 unrelated, age- and
gender-matched controls. Furthermore, to reduce the clinical heterogeneity, we
also carried out analysis in clinical subgroups of bipolar patients defined
according to type I and type II BPD, presence or absence of family history of
major affective disorders and the age at onset of BPD. No significant difference 
was found between either bipolar patients or its more homogeneous subgroups and
healthy controls in the genotype and allele frequencies for the investigated NET 
polymorphisms. Our results suggest that the investigated polymorphisms of NET are
not major risk factors responsible for predisposition to BPD or its clinical
subtypes in Han Chinese. However, replication studies with larger different
ethnic samples are needed.
