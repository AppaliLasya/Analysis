Background: Early diagnosis of breast cancer decreases mortality rate; therefore,
novel diagnostic methods are urgently required. In this study, authors aimed to
investigate the role of serum-derived miR-335 in breast cancer, and the
expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP9) and evaluating their feasibility and clinical utility as biomarkers for
the early detection of breast cancer.Materials and methods: Blood samples were
collected from a total of 210 individuals who were enrolled in this study. The
participants were divided into newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (n = 115), 
patients with benign breast lesions (n =55) and healthy individuals as control
group (n =40). The expression profile of miR-335, MMP2 and MMP9 were determined
using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).Results: MiR 335 expression
level was down-regulated in primary breast cancer group as compared to benign
breast group and healthy individuals with 98% and 94.9% sensitivity and
specificity, respectively. MMP2 and MMP9 showed significantly higher expression
levels in breast cancer group as compared to both benign and healthy group and
reporting 92.7% and 93% sensitivity, respectively. The relations between
investigated markers and pathologic types, staging, grading, and lymph node
involvement were significant with these factors. Expression level of miR-335 was 
decreased with increased MMP2 and MMP9 at significant level.Conclusion: MiR-335, 
MMP2, and MMP9 can be used as diagnostic markers in breast cancer.
