In several carcinomas, the SET Domain Containing 3, Actin Histidine
Methyltransferase (SETD3) is associated with oncogenesis. However, there is
little knowledge about the role of SETD3 in the progression and prognosis of
breast cancer. In this study, we first analyzed the prognostic value of SETD3 in 
breast cancer patients using the database of the public Kaplan-Meier plotter.
Moreover, in vitro assays were performed to assess the role of SETD3 in the
viability and capacity of invasion of human breast cancer cell lines. We observed
that the high expression of SETD3 was associated with better relapse-free
survival (RFS) of the whole collective of 3,951 patients, of Estrogen
Receptor-positive, and of Luminal A-type breast cancer patients. However, in
patients lacking expression of estrogen-, progesterone- and HER2-receptor, and
those affected by a p53-mutation, SETD3 was associated with poor RFS. In vitro
analysis showed that SETD3 siRNA depletion affects the viability of
triple-negative cells as well as the cytoskeletal function and capacity of
invasion of highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, SETD3 regulates the 
expression of other genes associated with cancer such as β-actin, FOXM1, FBXW7,
Fascin, eNOS, and MMP-2. Our study suggests that SETD3 expression can act as a
subtype-specific biomarker for breast cancer progression and prognosis.
