Introduction: Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective therapeutic method for preventing
the recurrence of breast cancer after surgery. The development and improvement of
RT are of interest to scientists. Possible improvement of RT via study of
dysregulated proteins of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 which is exposed to
10 Gray (Gy) radiation is aim of this study. Methods: Using protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network analysis by means of running Cytoscape software via the
STRING database, the up-regulated proteins of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
irradiated by a single and fractioned 10 Gy 137Cs γ-radiation were analyzed. The 
network was analyzed by using the Network analyzer to characterize the central
genes. The action map was mapped for the queried genes and the added neighbors
via CluePedia-STRING ACTIONS-v10.5- 20.11.2017. Results: The 14 differentially
expressed proteins (DEPs) plus 10 neighbors interacted to construct a network.
Among the 14 queried DEPs, FN1, CSPG4, LRP1, GSN, RTN4, and CTSD were highlighted
as a complex set in the analysis. The analysis revealed that SRC as an added
neighbor was activated by the critical DEPs. The activation of other oncogenes
like AKT1 was also determined. Conclusion: The results indicate that the
inhibition of SRC activity or the inhibition of its activators is a useful
function of breast cancer RT.
