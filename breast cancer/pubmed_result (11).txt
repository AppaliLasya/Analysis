Because the contribution of genetic factors to the burden of breast cancer is not
well investigated in Iran, we aimed to examine the prevalence of mutations in
breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1/2 and PALB2, and to investigate the
predictive potential of hereditary breast cancer risk criteria for genetic
testing in Iranian population. Next-generation sequencing was conducted on a
population consisting of 299 and 125 patients with breast cancer, with and
without hereditary cancer risk criteria for genetic testing, respectively. The
pathogenic mutation frequency rate was 10.7% in patients with hereditary cancer
criteria versus 1.6% in no criteria group (P = 0.0017). None of the 107 tested
patients with only young age at onset (<40) criterion had a pathogenic mutation. 
Patients who had only a single heritable risk criterion [OR, 6.15; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.26-58.59; P = 0.009] and patients with multiple heritable risk
criteria (OR, 22.5; 95% CI, 5.19-201.31; P < 0.0001) had higher probabilities of 
carrying a mutation compared with no criteria group. Our results showed that
young age at onset alone is not an indicator of hereditary breast cancer at least
in the Iranian population. This is while women with multiple hereditary breast
cancer risk criteria were enriched for BRCA1/2 mutations. Given such high risk of
identification of a disease-causing mutation, multiple hereditary criteria should
be regarded as a strong predictor for a hereditary breast cancer syndrome. These 
findings are important concerning the optimization of genetic counseling and
furthermore establishing criteria for BRCA1/2 testing of the Iranian population.
