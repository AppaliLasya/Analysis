PIK3CA gene mutations in the helical domain correlate with high tumor mutation
burden and poor prognosis in metastatic breast carcinomas with late-line
therapies.

Nearly half of metastatic breast cancers (MBC) have genetic aberrations in the
PI3K/AKT pathway. To investigate the distinct effect of these aberrations on MBC,
193 MBC patients who progressed after the early line (â‰¤2) salvage treatment
voluntarily received next generation sequencing (NGS) for a panel of 1,021 genes.
93 (48%) patients had genetic aberrations in the PI3K/AKT pathway. The number of 
patients with PIK3CA mutations in kinase domain (KD), helical domain (HD) and
other domain (OD), were 36 (18.7%), 26 (13.5%), 10 (5.2%), respectively. 21
(10.9%) patients had mutations in PI3K/AKT pathway genes other than PIK3CA (P/A).
Compared to PI3K/AKT-wild type (WT) patients, PIK3CA-HD patients had a
significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (Logrank p-value < 0.0001).
PIK3CA-KD, PIK3CA-OD and other P/A mutations showed similar PFS to WT patients
(Logrank p-value = 0.63). PIK3CA-HD patients had a distinct ctDNA mutation
profile to patients with other PI3K/AKT mutations. PIK3CA-HD patients had a
higher rate of FGFR and NF1 aberrations. In addition, more PIK3CA-HD carriers
were TMB-high. Cox regression analyses suggested that PIK3CA-HD mutations, FGFR
aberrations and high TMB were all significant risk factors for poor PFS. In
conclusion, future research needs to focus more on the treatment strategies
targeting PIK3CA-HD mutations.
