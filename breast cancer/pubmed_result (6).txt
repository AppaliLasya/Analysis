BACKGROUND: Immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of Ki67 has been identified as a
prognostic and predictive marker in hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer,
however, there is little evidence of the association of Ki67 with prognosis in
HR-negative patients. We aimed to assess the benefit of Ki67 assessment in
HR-negative breast cancers after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
METHODS: In the present study, a total of 183 HR-negative breast cancer patients 
with Stage II to III that treated with anthracycline and/or taxane-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2004 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed.
Endocrine therapy and trastuzumab was not administered to any patients in this
study. Clinical and pathological features of the patients with breast cancer were
retrieved from the hospital records. Predictive factors for NAC response and
survival were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 183 patients, 122 (66.6%) were HR- HER2+, and 61 (33.3%) were
triple-negative. The clinical response rates were similar across breast cancer
subtype. Patients whose tumors contained high Ki67 expression effectively
responded to NAC. Ki67 labeling index was a predictive marker for pathologic
complete response (pCR). Ki67 expression showed a positive correlation with HER2 
status, tumor size, lymph node status, lymphovascular invasion and tumor grade.
Furthermore, high Ki67 expression in post-treatment tumors was strongly
correlated with poor disease-free survival (DFS), but no correlation of Ki-67
expression with overall survival (OS) was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Ki67 expression in HR-negative breast
cancer may improve the assessment of pathological response after NAC, and Ki67
score in residual tumor was an independent prognosticator for DFS in the
HR-negative breast cancer patients.
