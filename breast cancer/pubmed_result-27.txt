Background: Breast cancer (BC) is well-known as the most common malignancy and
the first leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Evidence
suggests that familial history and age are important risk factors for the
development of this disease in Iran. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the
cause of 5 to 10% of hereditary BC. Recent studies demonstrated that mutations in
BRCA1 were observed in high-risk women with family histories of BC. However, to
date, the mutations have not been elucidated in BC patients from east of Iran.
The purpose of this study was to analyze BRCA1 mutations in BC patient from South
Khorasan Province. Methods: In the present study, 88 BC patients (11 positive
family history) were screened for mutations in BRCA1. The analysis of BRCA1 was
carried out by SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) for shorter exons
and direct sequencing in the case of longer ones. Results: Twenty-eight of the
patients (31.8%) had a synonymous mutation (c.4308T>C) in exon 13. A missense
mutation (c. 4837A>G) was presented in exon 16 with a frequency of 56.8 %. In
exon 11 three missense mutations were observed, and the frequency rate for
c.3113A>G was 32.5%, for c.3119G>A was 5%, and the highest frequency belonged to 
c.3548A>G with 72.4% in familial BC and 45.4% in the non-familial group.
Conclusion: In our study, five mutations were found, but none of the founder
mutations were identified in this population. Two missense mutations in exon 16
(56.8%) and in exon 11 (65%) had the highest frequency in South Khorasan
Province.
