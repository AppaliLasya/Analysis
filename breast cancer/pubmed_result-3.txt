Early age at diagnosis of breast cancer is a known risk factor for hereditary
predisposition and some studies show a high risk of contralateral breast cancer
in BRCA1 carriers diagnosed at very young ages. However, little is published on
the risk of TP53 carriers. 397 women with breast cancer diagnosed <36 years of
age were obtained from three sources: (i) a population-based study of 283 women
diagnosed sequentially from 1980-1997 in North-West England, (ii) referrals to
the Genomic Medicine Department at St Mary's Hospital from 1990-2018, and (iii)
individuals from (i) and the Family History Clinic at Wythenshawe Hospital South 
Manchester who tested negative for pathogenic variants (PV) in all three genes.
Sequencing of BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 genes was carried out alongside tests for
copy number for PV on all referred women. Rates of contralateral breast cancer
were censored at death, last assessment, or risk-reducing mastectomy. In total,
47 TP53, 218 BRCA1, and 132 BRCA2 PV carriers were identified with breast cancer 
diagnosed aged 35 years and under, as well as a representative sample of 261 not 
known to carry a PV in BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53. Annual rates of contralateral
breast cancer (and percentage of synchronous breast cancers) were TP53: 7.03%
(4.3%), BRCA1: 3.57% (1.8%), and BRCA2: 2.63% (1.5%). In non-PV carriers,
contralateral rates in isolated presumed/tested non-carrier cases with no family 
history were 0.56%, and for those with a family history, 0.69%. Contralateral
breast cancer rates are substantial in TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 PV carriers
diagnosed with breast cancer aged 35 and under. Women need to be advised to help 
make informed decisions on contralateral mastectomy, guided by life expectancy
from their index tumor.
