BACKGROUND: Breast cancer risk, development, and treatment are influenced by
genetic variation in certain genes, namely those involved in cell proliferation, 
tumor suppression, and drug metabolism. In turn, the relevance of the
aforementioned genetic variation to cancer depends on the ethnic group in
question, highlighting the need for population-specific association studies.
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the association 
between certain ESR1, ESR2, HER2, UGT1A4, and UGT2B7 single nucleotide
polymorphisms and breast cancer.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 437 Jordanian-Arab breast cancer
patients and healthy volunteers and subject to genotyping using the Sequenom
MassARRAY® system (iPLEX GOLD).
RESULTS: Our findings show a significant association between breast cancer and
the allelic (P = 0.02486879) and genotypic (P = 0.04793066) frequencies of the
ESR1 polymorphism rs3798577, a result which was confirmed in different genetic
models. No other investigated polymorphism showed a significant association with 
breast cancer itself in Jordanian Arabs, but the Rare Hz (GG) vs Het (AG) genetic
model revealed an association of the disease with the ESR1 polymorphism
rs3798577. However, several associations were found between certain polymorphisms
and breast cancer's prognostic factors.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that certain polymorphisms may increase the risk 
of breast cancer in the Jordanian-Arab population. Future research and clinical
translation could incorporate the current results in preventative breast cancer
approaches tailored for Jordanian-Arab patients.
