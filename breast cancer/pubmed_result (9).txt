This study suggests that two newly discovered variants in the MSH2 gene, which
codes for a DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein, can be associated with a high risk
of breast cancer. While variants in the MSH2 gene are known to be linked with an 
elevated cancer risk, the MSH2 gene is not a part of the standard kit for testing
patients for elevated breast cancer risk. Here we used the results of genetic
testing of women diagnosed with breast cancer, but who did not have variants in
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Instead, the test identified four variants with unknown
significance (VUS) in the MSH2 gene. Here, we carried in silico analysis to
develop a classifier that can distinguish pathogenic from benign mutations in
MSH2 genes taken from ClinVar. The classifier was then used to classify VUS in
MSH2 genes, and two of them, p.Ala272Val and p.Met592Val, were predicted to be
pathogenic mutations. These two mutations were found in women with breast cancer 
who did not have mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and thus they are suggested 
to be considered as new bio-markers for the early detection of elevated breast
cancer risk. However, before this is done, an in vitro validation of mutation
pathogenicity is needed and, moreover, the presence of these mutations should be 
demonstrated in a higher number of patients or in families with breast cancer
history.
