BRG1, an active subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, enables the 
EP300-dependent transcription of proliferation and DNA repair genes from their
E2F/CpG-driven promoters in breast cancer cells. In the current study, we show
that BRG1-EP300 complexes are accompanied by poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1
(PARP1), which emerges as the functional component of the promoter-bound
multiprotein units that are capable of controlling gene expression. This enzyme
is co-distributed with BRG1 at highly acetylated promoters of genes such as CDK4,
LIG1, or NEIL3, which are responsible for cancer cell growth and the removal of
DNA damage. ADP-ribosylation is necessary to maintain active transcription, since
it ensures an open chromatin structure that allows high acetylation and low
histone density. PARP1-mediated modification of BRG1 and EP300 does not affect
the association of enzymes with gene promoters; however, it does activate EP300, 
which acetylates nucleosomes, leading to their eviction by BRG1, thus allowing
mRNA synthesis. Although PARP1 was found at BRG1 positive/H3K27ac negative
promoters of highly expressed genes in a transformed breast cancer cell line, its
transcriptional activity was limited to genes simultaneously controlled by BRG1
and EP300, indicating that the ADP-ribosylation of EP300 plays a dominant role in
the regulation of BRG1-EP300-driven transcription. In conclusion, PARP1 directs
the transcription of some proliferation and DNA repair genes in breast cancer
cells by the ADP-ribosylation of EP300, thereby causing its activation and
marking nucleosomes for displacement by BRG1. PARP1 in rapidly dividing cells
facilitates the expression of genes that confer a cancer cell phenotype. Our
study shows a new mechanism that links PARP1 with the removal of DNA damage in
breast cancer cells via the regulation of BRG1-EP300-dependent transcription of
genes involved in DNA repair pathways.
