Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for ~15-20% of breast cancer (BC)
and has a higher rate of early relapse and mortality compared to other subtypes. 
The Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) and its signaling pathway have been
linked to TNBC. We aimed to investigate the susceptibility and prognostic
implications of genetic variation in CCL5 signaling genes in TNBC in the present 
study. We characterized variants in CCL5 and that of six other CCL5 signaling
genes (CCND1, ZMIZ1, CASP8, NOTCH2, MAP3K21, and HS6ST3) among 1,082 unrelated
Tunisian subjects (544 BC patients, including 196 TNBC, and 538 healthy
controls), assessed the association of the variants with BC-specific overall
survival (OVS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and correlated CCL5 mRNA and 
serum levels with CCL5 genotypes. We found a highly significant association
between the CCND1 rs614367-TT genotype (OR = 5.14; P = 0.004) and TNBC risk, and 
identified a significant association between the rs614367-T allele and decreased 
PFS in TNBC. A decreased risk of lymph node metastasis was associated with the
MAP3K21 rs1294255-C allele, particularly in rs1294255-GC (OR = 0.47; P = 0.001). 
CCL5 variants (rs2107538 and rs2280789) were linked to CCL5 serum and mRNA
levels. In the TCGA TNBC/Basal-like cohort the MAP3K21 rs1294255-G allele was
associated with a decreased OVS. High expression of CCL5 in breast tumors was
significantly associated with an increased OVS in all BC patients, but
particularly in TNBC/Basal-like patients. In conclusion, genetic variation in
CCL5 signaling genes may predict not only TNBC risk but also disease
aggressiveness.
