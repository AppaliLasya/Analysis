Poor prognosis breast cancers are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, but often 
without any guidance from therapy predictive markers since universally-accepted
markers are not currently available. Treatment failure, in the form of
recurrences, is relatively common. We aimed to identify chemotherapy predictive
markers and resistance pathways in breast cancer. Our hypothesis was that tumour 
cells remaining after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) contain somatic variants
causing therapy resistance, while variants present pre-NAC but lost post-NAC
cause sensitivity. Whole exome sequencing was performed on matched pre- and
post-NAC cancer cells, which were isolated by laser microdissection, from 6
cancer cases, and somatic variants selected for or against by NAC were
identified. Somatic variant diversity was significantly reduced after therapy
(p<0.05). MUC17 variants were identified in 3 tumours and were selected against
by NAC in each case, while PCNX1 variants were identified in 2 tumours and were
selected for in both cases, implicating the function of these genes in defining
chemoresponse. In vitro knock-down of MUC17 or PCNX1 was associated with
significantly increased or decreased chemotherapy sensitivity respectively
(p<0.05), further supporting their roles in chemotherapy response. Expression was
tested for predictive value in two independent cohorts of chemotherapy-treated
breast cancers (n=53, n=303). Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that low MUC17
expression was significantly associated with longer survival after chemotherapy, 
while low PCNX1 was significantly associated with reduced survival. We concluded 
that therapy-driven selection of somatic variants allows identification of
chemotherapy response genes. With respect to MUC17 and PCNX1, therapy-driven
selection acting on somatic variants, in vitro knock-down data concerning drug
sensitivity, and survival analysis of expression levels in patient cohorts all
define the genes as mediators of and predictive markers for chemotherapy response
in breast cancer.
