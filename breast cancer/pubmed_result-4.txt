Genome-wide screening of transcriptional changes among normal, cancer, and nodal 
metastases provides insights into the molecular basis of breast cancer (BC)
progression and metastasis. To identify transcriptional changes and
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the metastatic progression of BC and to 
determine the prognostic role of these DEGs in clinical outcome, we compared
transcriptome profiling in matched normal, cancer, and lymph node metastatic
tissues of 7 patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative BC by using 
massive parallel RNA sequencing. The global profiles of gene expression in cancer
and nodal metastases were highly correlated (r=0.962, P<0.001). In 6 (85.8%)
patients, cancer and corresponding nodal metastases from the same patient
clustered together. We identified 1522 and 664 DEGs between normal and cancer and
between cancer and nodal metastases, respectively. The DEGs in normal versus
cancer and cancer versus nodal metastases were significantly clustered in 1 and 8
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, respectively. The
chemokine signaling pathway was the most significant pathway in the
cancer-to-nodal metastasis transition (false discovery rate=2.15E-13). The
expression of 2 dysregulated RAC2 and PTGDS genes was confirmed by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, the 
lower RAC2 and PTGDS expression were associated with significantly worse
disease-free survival in patients with BC. Our results show a high concordance of
gene expression in BC and their nodal metastases, and identify DEGs associated
with the metastatic progression of BC. The DEGs identified in this study
represent novel biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of patients with BC.
