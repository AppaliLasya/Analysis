Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare cancer that preferentially occurs in the
head and neck, breast, as well as in other sites. It is an aggressive cancer with
high rates of recurrence and distant metastasis. Patients with advanced disease
are generally incurable due to the lack of effective systemic therapies.
Activation of the master transcriptional regulator MYB is the genomic hallmark of
ACC. MYB activation occurs through chromosomal translocation, copy number gain or
enhancer hijacking, and is the key driving event in the pathogenesis of ACC.
However, the functional consequences of alternative mechanisms of MYB activation 
are still uncertain. Here, we show that overexpression of MYB or MYB-NFIB fusions
leads to transformation of human glandular epithelial cells in vitro and results 
in analogous cellular and molecular consequences. MYB and MYB-NFIB expression led
to increased cell proliferation and upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle 
control, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Notably, we identified the DNA-damage
sensor kinase ATR, as a MYB downstream therapeutic target that is overexpressed
in primary ACCs and ACC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Treatment with the
clinical ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 induced apoptosis in MYB-positive ACC cells 
and growth inhibition in ACC PDXs. To our knowledge, ATR is the first example of 
an actionable target downstream of MYB that could be further exploited for
therapeutic opportunities in ACC patients. Our findings may also have
implications for other types of neoplasms with activation of the MYB oncogene.
