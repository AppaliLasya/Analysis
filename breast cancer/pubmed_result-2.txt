Identification of candidate genes associated with susceptibility of breast cancer
can have a significant impact at a cancer management national healthcare systems 
level, making genetic testing more affordable and cost-effective. We have
previously shown that the major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain 
A (MICA) was related to breast cancer and plays an important role in modulating
immune response mechanisms through NKG2D receptor activation. Compared to our
previous study, in this work, we recruited a new cohort composed of 354 unrelated
Tunisian women affected by breast cancer and 380 age-matched women as controls,
all genotyped for MICA-129 Met/Val (rs 1051792). Subsequently, we exanimated the 
distribution of this polymorphism in ten families. As a result, an association
was found between the Val allele and Val/Val genotype and the risk of breast
cancer (p = 2.5 × 10-15 ; OR = 2.40; p = 6.5 × 10-13 ; OR = 3.03, respectively). 
Stratified analysis with age and family history of cancer revealed an association
between the Val/Val genotype and younger patients <40 years (p = .003;
OR = 2.03). Among those patients having a family history of cancer, 68% had a
Val/Val genotype (p = .02; OR = 1.82). In the family study, an analyse of
pedigrees revealed that the majority of families showed the development of breast
cancer at a young age. Moreover, all patients diagnosed with early-onset breast
cancer had a Val/Val genotype. Our results lead us to propose that this
polymorphism may be an inherited genetic biomarker contributing to an increased
breast cancer risk in Tunisian women.

We previously demonstrated that expression of a Krüppel-like zinc finger
transcription factor, GLIS1, dramatically increases under hypoxic conditions via 
a transcriptional mechanism induced by HIF-2α co-operating with AP-1 members. In 
this study, we focused on the functional roles of GLIS1 in breast cancer. To
uncover its biological function, the effects of altered levels of GLIS1 in breast
cancer cell lines on cellular growth, wound-healing, and invasion capacities were
assessed. Knockdown of GLIS1 using siRNA in BT-474 cells resulted in significant 
growth stimulation under normoxia, while attenuation was found in the cell
invasion assay under hypoxic conditions. In MDA-MB-231 cells expressing exogenous
3xFLAG-tagged GLIS1, GLIS1 attenuated cell proliferation and enhanced cell
mobility and invasion capacities under normoxia. In addition, breast cancer cells
expressing GLIS1 acquired resistance to irradiation. Whole transcriptome analysis
clearly demonstrated that downstream signals of GLIS1 are related to various
cellular functions. Among the genes with increased expression, we focused on
WNT5A. Knockdown of WNT5A indicated that enhancement of acquired cell motility in
the MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GLIS1 was mediated, at least in part, by WNT5A.
In an analysis of publicly available data, patients with estrogen receptor
negative breast cancer showing high levels of GLIS1 expression showed much worse 
prognosis than those with low levels. In summary, hypoxia-induced GLIS1 plays
significant roles in breast cancer cells via regulation of gene expression
related to cell migration and invasion capacities, resulting in poorer prognosis 
in patients with advanced breast cancer.

Tumour-infiltrating immune cells have been indicated to play an important role in
prognosis prediction and therapy sensitivity for breast cancer. In recent years, 
estimating the abundance of immune cells based on tumour transcriptome data has
provided a novel way to analyse the clinical significance of various immune cell 
subsets. This study integrated breast cancer tissue transcriptome datasets from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Cancer Genome Atlas-Breast Cancer
(TCGA-BRCA) and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium 
(METABRIC) cohorts. A novel breast cancer immunotyping and a new prognostic model
based on tumour-infiltrating immune cell subsets have been established, aiming to
provide new clues regarding prognostic prediction and precision therapy for
breast cancer. The key differentially expressed gene between different breast
cancer immunotypes has also been identified. We performed unsupervised clustering
analysis and construct a novel immunotyping which could classify breast cancer
cases into immunotype A (B_cellhigh NKhigh CD8+_Thigh CD4+_memory_T_activatedhigh
γδTlow Mast_cell_activatedlow Neutrophillow) and immunotype B (B_celllow NKlow
CD8+_Tlow CD4+_memory_T_activatedlow γδThigh Mast_cell_activatedhigh
Neutrophilhigh) in luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like subtypes. The 5-year
(85.7% vs. 73.4%) and 10-year OS (75.60% vs. 61.73%) of immunotype A population
were significantly higher than those of immunotype B. A novel tumour-infiltrating
immune cell-based prognostic model had also been established and the result
immunorisk score (IRS) could serve as a new prognostic factor for luminal B,
HER2-enriched and basal-like breast cancer. The higher IRS was, the worse
prognosis was. We further screened the differentially expressed genes between
immunotype A and B and identified a novel breast cancer immune-related gene,
prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) and higher PTGDS mRNA expression level was
positively correlated with earlier TNM stage. Immune-related signaling pathways
analysis and immune cell subsets correlation analysis revealed that PTGDS
expression was related with abundance of B cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, 
which was finally validated by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence
staining. We established a novel immunotyping and a tumour-infiltrating immune
cell-based prognostic prediction model in luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like
breast cancer by analyzing the prognostic significance of multiple immune cell
subsets. A novel breast cancer immune signature gene PTDGS was discovered, which 
might serve as a protective prognostic factor and play an important role in
breast cancer development and lymphocyte-related immune response.
