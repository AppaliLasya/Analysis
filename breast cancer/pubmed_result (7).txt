Frequent mutation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway genes in human cancers has
stimulated large investments in targeted drugs but clinical successes are rare.
As a result, many cancers with high PI3K pathway activity, such as
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are treated primarily with chemotherapy. By
systematically analyzing responses of TNBC cells to a diverse collection of PI3K 
pathway inhibitors, we find that one drug, Torin2, is unusually effective because
it inhibits both mTOR and other PI3K-like kinases (PIKKs). In contrast to
mTOR-selective inhibitors, Torin2 exploits dependencies on several kinases for
S-phase progression and cell-cycle checkpoints, thereby causing accumulation of
single-stranded DNA and death by replication catastrophe or mitotic failure.
Thus, Torin2 and its chemical analogs represent a mechanistically distinct class 
of PI3K pathway inhibitors that are uniquely cytotoxic to TNBC cells. This
insight could be translated therapeutically by further developing Torin2 analogs 
or combinations of existing mTOR and PIKK inhibitors.
