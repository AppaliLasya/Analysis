BACKGROUND: With the increasing use of multigene panel tests, pathogenic and
likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants are identified more frequently in the
moderate-penetrance breast cancer genes ATM and CHEK2. Lifetime breast cancer
risk among women with P/LP variants in these genes generally exceeds 20%, meeting
the threshold at which high-risk breast cancer screening through breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended.
METHODS: Among a registry-based sample of 56 ATM and 69 CHEK2 carriers, the
authors sought to determine the percentage of relatives in whom a P/LP variant
would impact breast cancer surveillance. Lifetime breast cancer risks for
unaffected, female first-degree and second-degree relatives were estimated using 
the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation
Algorithm (BOADICEA).
RESULTS: Among first-degree relatives of ATM and CHEK2 carriers, only 22.6% and
14.9%, respectively, were found to have lifetime breast cancer risks of ≥20%
based on family cancer history alone; however, when including the proband's P/LP 
variant in the model, these percentages increased significantly to 56.6% and
55.3%, respectively (P < .0001 and P < .0001, respectively). Similar increases in
lifetime breast cancer risks were found among second-degree relatives.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that the majority of female
first-degree and second-degree relatives of ATM and CHEK2 carriers do not qualify
for breast MRI based on family cancer history alone. Therefore, testing for these
genes, as well as awareness of positive moderate-penetrance breast cancer gene
results in the family, may impact MRI eligibility. These findings highlight the
potential usefulness of and need for breast cancer risk models that incorporate
moderate-penetrance gene positivity to inform screening recommendations among
at-risk family members.
