Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women that is responsible for 
the most of the cancer-related death in worldwide. Drug resistance is remaining
as a significant clinical obstacle to treat BC patients effectively. Therefore,
to help overcome this problem, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of
drug resistance. microRNAs classify as highly conserved non-coding RNAs (∼22
nucleotides) and interact with mRNAs-coding genes for direct post-transcriptional
repression. It has been reported that miR-21 is overexpressed and also acts as
oncomiR in many human malignancies by targeting of several tumor suppressor
genes-associated with apoptosis, proliferation and metastasis. Specifically, it
has been reported that miR-21 is responsible for the drug resistance and its
overexpression is related to the development of Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) in
breast cancer. In this review, we discussed about the role of miR-21 on the drug 
resistance of breast cancer.
