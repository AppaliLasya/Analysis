This study aimed to (1) identify subgroups of women with breast cancer with the
psychological symptom cluster (fatigue, depressive symptoms, and anxiety) during 
the first 18 months of adjuvant therapy and (2) explore associations between
demographic and clinical characteristics and variations in genetic polymorphisms 
related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and predicted
symptom trajectory subgroup membership. We obtained symptom data at 4 time points
from baseline to 18 months of adjuvant therapy among 292 postmenopausal women
with breast cancer. Genetic data were collected in a subgroup at baseline (N =
184). Group-based multitrajectory modeling was used to classify women into
subgroups with similar psychological symptom cluster trajectories. Binary
logistic regression was used to explore the associations between each genotypic
and phenotypic predictor and predicted subgroup membership. Two distinct symptom 
subgroups (low and high) were identified based on the trajectories of the symptom
cluster of fatigue, depressive symptoms, and anxiety over the first 18 months of 
adjuvant therapy. Women who were younger, less educated, and who received
chemotherapy had greater likelihood of being in the high-symptom subgroup.
Variation in genes regulating the HPA axis (FKBP5 rs9394309 [odds ratio (OR) =
3.98, p = .015], NR3C2 rs5525 [OR = 2.54, p = .036], and CRHR1 rs12944712 [OR =
3.99, p = .021]) was associated with membership in the high-symptom subgroup.
These results may help to identify women with breast cancer who are at increased 
risk for psychological symptoms, facilitating the development of individualized
and preemptive interventions to better manage these symptoms during adjuvant
therapy.
