Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed into the bloodstream from primary tumors,
but only a small subset generates metastases. We conducted an in vivo genome-wide
CRISPR activation screen in breast cancer patient-derived CTCs to identify genes 
that promote their distant metastasis in mice. Genes coding for ribosomal
proteins and regulators of translation were enriched in this screen.
Overexpression of RPL15, which encodes a component of the large ribosomal
subunit, increased metastatic growth in multiple organs and selectively enhanced 
translation of other ribosomal proteins and cell cycle regulators. RNA-sequencing
of freshly-isolated CTCs from breast cancer patients revealed a subset with
strong ribosome and protein synthesis signatures; these CTCs expressed
proliferation and epithelial markers and correlated with poor clinical outcome.
Therapies targeting this aggressive subset of CTCs may merit exploration as
potential suppressors of metastatic progression.
