Background: The tumor protein p73 (TP73) is a homolog of TP53 family. Ectopic p73
overexpression largely mimics p53 activities as a tumor suppressor and activates 
the transcription of p53-responsive genes and as a result induce apoptosis. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between p73 G4A polymorphism and the
risk of breast cancer in a northeastern Iranian population.
Methods: This case-control study was performed on 105 patients who admitted in
educational hospitals of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran during
2013-2015, with breast cancer as case group and 120 healthy women as the control 
group. PCR-CTPP method was used to investigate the relationship between the p73
G4A polymorphism and the risk of breast cancer.
Results: There was no significant association between the AA genotype of the p73 
G4A polymorphism and breast cancer in case and control groups. Although G allele 
frequency was higher in the case group, the abundance of this allele between case
and control groups was not statistically meaningful and, as a result, not
associated with the risk of breast cancer in this study group.
Conclusion: There was no association between G4A p73 polymorphism and the risk of
breast cancer in a northeastern Iranian population.
