BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical
cystectomy (RC) is the standard of care for patients with muscle-invasive bladder
cancer (MIBC). It is unknown whether this treatment strategy is appropriate for
patients who progress to MIBC after treatment for prior noninvasive disease
(secondary MIBC).
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical and genomic differences exist between
primary and secondary MIBC treated with NAC and RC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinicopathologic outcomes were compared
between 245 patients with clinical T2-4aN0M0-stage primary MIBC and 43 with
secondary MIBC treated with NAC and RC at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
(MSKCC) from 2001 to 2015. Genomic differences were assessed in a retrospective
cohort of 385 prechemotherapy specimens sequenced by whole-exome or targeted exon
capture by the Cancer Genome Atlas or at MSKCC. Findings were confirmed in an
independent validation cohort of 94 MIBC patients undergoing prospective targeted
exon sequencing at MSKCC.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Pathologic response rates,
recurrence-free survival (RFS), bladder cancer-specific survival (CSS), and
overall survival (OS) were measured. Differences in somatic genomic alteration
rates were compared using Fisher's exact test and the Benjamini-Hochberg false
discovery rate method.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Patients with secondary MIBC had lower pathologic
response rates following NAC than those with primary MIBC (univariable: 26% vs
45%, multivariable: odds ratio=0.4 [95% confidence interval=0.18-0.84] p=0.02)
and significantly worse RFS, CSS, and OS. Patients with secondary MIBC treated
with NAC had worse CSS compared with cystectomy alone (p=0.002). In a separate
genomic analysis, we detected significantly more likely deleterious somatic ERCC2
missense mutations in primary MIBC tumors in both the discovery (10.9% [36/330]
vs 1.8% [1/55], p=0.04) and the validation (15.7% [12/70] vs 0% [0/24], p=0.03)
cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with secondary MIBC treated with NAC had worse clinical
outcomes than similarly treated patients with primary MIBC. ERCC2 mutations
predicted to result in increased cisplatin sensitivity were enriched in primary
versus secondary MIBC. Prospective validation is still needed, but given the lack
of clinical benefit with cisplatin-based NAC in patients with secondary MIBC,
upfront RC or enrollment in clinical trials should be considered.
PATIENT SUMMARY: A retrospective cohort study of patients with "primary" and
"secondary" muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) treated with chemotherapy
before surgical removal of the bladder identified lower response rates and
shorter survival in patients with secondary MIBC. Tumor genetic sequencing of
separate discovery and validation cohorts revealed that chemotherapy-sensitizing 
DNA damage repair gene mutations occur predominantly in primary MIBC tumors and
may underlie the greater sensitivity of primary MIBC to chemotherapy. Prospective
validation is still needed, but patients with secondary MIBC may derive greater
benefit from upfront surgery or enrollment in clinical trials rather than from
standard chemotherapy.
