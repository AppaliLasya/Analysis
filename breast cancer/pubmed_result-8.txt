Several studies have found that DNA methylation is associated with
transcriptional regulation and affect sponge regulation of non-coding RNAs in
cancer. The integration of circRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation and gene expression
data to identify sponge circRNAs is important for revealing the role of DNA
methylation-mediated regulation of sponge circRNAs in cancer progression. We
established a DNA methylation-mediated circRNA crosstalk network by integrating
gene expression, DNA methylation and non-coding RNA data of breast cancer in
TCGA. Four modules (26 candidate circRNAs) were mined. Next, 10 DNA
methylation-mediated sponge circRNAs (sp_circRNAs) and five sponge driver genes
(sp_driver genes) in breast cancer were identified in the CMD network using a
computational process. Among the identified genes, ERBB2 was associated with six 
sponge circRNAs, which illustrates its better sponge regulatory function.
Survival analysis showed that DNA methylations of 10 sponge circRNA host genes
are potential prognostic biomarkers in the TCGA dataset (p = 0.0239) and GSE78754
dataset (p = 0.0377). In addition, the DNA methylation of two sponge circRNA host
genes showed a significant negative correlation with their driver gene
expressions. We developed a strategy to predict sponge circRNAs by DNA
methylation mediated with playing the role of regulating breast cancer sponge
driver genes.
