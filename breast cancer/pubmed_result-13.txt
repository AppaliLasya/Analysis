BACKGROUND: BRD7 is a tumor suppressor known to inhibit cell proliferation and
cell cycle progression and initiate apoptosis in breast cancer. However, the
function and underlying molecular events of BRD7 in tumor invasion and metastasis
in breast cancer are not fully understood.
METHODS: BRD7 expression was assessed in two stable cell lines MDA231 and MCF7
with BRD7 overexpression and one stable cell line MDA231 with BRD7 interference
using qRT-PCR and western blotting. CCK8 assay was used to examine the
proliferation ability of MDA231 and MCF7 cells. Scratch wound healing assay was
used to evaluate cell migration in MDA231 and MCF7 cells. Both Matrigel and
three-dimensional invasion assays were performed to investigate the cell invasion
ability after BRD7 overexpression or silencing or YB1 restoration in MDA231 and
MCF7 cells. The potential interacting proteins of BRD7 were screened using
co-immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry and verified by
co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293T cells. Additionally, we confirmed the specific 
binding region between BRD7 and YB1 in HEK293T cells by constructing a series of 
deletion mutants of BRD7 and YB1 respectively. Finally, xenograft and metastatic 
mouse models using MDA231 cells were established to confirm the effect of BRD7 on
tumor growth and metastasis.
RESULTS: Here, the results of a series of assays in vitro indicated that BRD7 has
the ability to inhibit the mobility, migration and invasion of breast cancer
cells. In addition, YB1 was identified as a novel interacting protein of BRD7,
and BRD7 was found to associate with the C-terminus of YB1 via its N-terminus.
BRD7 decreases the expression of YB1 through negatively regulating YB1
phosphorylation at Ser102, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation.
Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) is the common change occurring with altered expression of either
BRD7 or YB1 and that BRD7 represses mesenchymal genes and activates epithelial
genes. Moreover, restoring the expression of YB1 antagonized the inhibitory
effect of BRD7 on tumorigenicity, EMT, invasiveness and metastasis through a
series of inÂ vitro and in vivo experiments. Additionally, BRD7 expression was
negatively correlated with the level of YB1 in breast cancer patients. The
combination of low BRD7 and high YB1 expression was significantly associated with
poor prognosis, distant metastasis and advanced TNM stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings uncover that BRD7 blocks tumor growth, 
migration and metastasis by negatively regulating YB1-induced EMT, providing new 
insights into the mechanism by which BRD7 contributes to the progression and
metastasis of breast cancer.
