Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women globally. Genetic 
mutations can increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Inherited germline
mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes (gBRCAm) account for 5% to
10% of breast cancer cases. The recent approval of olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer provides 
an additional treatment option for patients with a gBRCAm. Inhibition of PARP
results in the trapping of the PARP-DNA complex at replication forks, causing
single-strand breaks to become double-strand breaks (DSBs). PARP trapping and the
accumulation of DSBs ultimately leads to cell apoptosis. Cells deficient in
BRCA1/2 are particularly sensitive to the effects of PARP inhibition, as cells
lacking these functional proteins are unable to repair DSBs, resulting in
synthetic lethality. The phase III OlympiAD trial showed a progression-free
survival benefit but no overall survival benefit, leading to the US Food and Drug
Administration approval of olaparib. The purpose of this article is to describe
current data regarding the use of olaparib in metastatic breast cancer, its role 
in the treatment of patients with a gBRCAm, and the clinical implications of its 
approval for oncology advanced practitioners.
