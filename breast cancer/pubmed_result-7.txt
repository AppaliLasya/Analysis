BACKGROUND: The Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC) occurs in
families with a history of breast/ovarian cancer, presenting an autosomal
dominant inheritance pattern. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are high penetrance genes
associated with an increased risk of up to 20-fold for breast and ovarian cancer.
However, only 20-30% of HBOC cases present pathogenic variants in those genes,
and other DNA repair genes have emerged as increasing the risk for HBOC. In
Brazil, variants in ATM, ATR, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, POLQ, PTEN, and TP53 genes
have been reported in up to 7.35% of the studied cases. Here we screened and
characterized variants in 21 DNA repair genes in HBOC patients.
METHODS: We systematically analyzed 708 amplicons encompassing the coding and
flanking regions of 21 genes related to DNA repair pathways (ABRAXAS1, ATM, ATR, 
BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, MLH1, MRE11, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PALB2,
PMS2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51, TP53 and UIMC1). A total of 95 individuals with HBOC
syndrome clinical suspicion in Southeast Brazil were sequenced, and 25 samples
were evaluated for insertions/deletions in BRCA1/BRCA2 genes. Identified variants
were assessed in terms of population allele frequency and their functional
effects were predicted through in silico algorithms.
RESULTS: We identified 80 variants in 19 genes. About 23.4% of the patients
presented pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53, a frequency higher than
that identified among previous studies in Brazil. We identified a novel variant
in ATR, which was predicted as pathogenic by in silico tools. The association
analysis revealed 13 missense variants in ABRAXAS1, BARD1, BRCA2, CHEK2, CDH1,
MLH1, PALB2, and PMS2 genes, as significantly associated with increased risk to
HBOC, and the patients carrying those variants did not present large insertions
or deletions in BRCA1/BRCA2 genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study embodies the third report of a multi-gene analysis in the
Brazilian population, and addresses the first report of many germline variants
associated with HBOC in Brazil. Although further functional analyses are
necessary to better characterize the contribution of those variants to the
phenotype, these findings would improve the risk estimation and clinical
follow-up of patients with HBOC clinical suspicion.
