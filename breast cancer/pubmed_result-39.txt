Paclitaxel (Tx) is a widely used therapeutic chemical for breast cancer
treatment; however, cancer recurrence remains an obstacle for improved prognosis 
of cancer patients. In this study, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) was tested for
its potential to overcome the drug resistance. After developing Tx-resistant
MCF-7 (MCF-7/TxR) breast cancer cells, CAP was applied to the cells, and its
effect on the recovery of drug sensitivity was assessed in both cellular and
molecular aspects. Sensitivity to Tx in the MCF-7/TxR cells was restored up to
73% by CAP. A comparison of genome-wide expression profiles between the TxR cells
and the CAP-treated cells identified 49 genes that commonly appeared with
significant changes. Notably, 20 genes, such as KIF13B, GOLM1, and TLE4, showed
opposite expression profiles. The protein expression levels of selected genes,
DAGLA and CEACAM1, were recovered to those of their parental cells by CAP. Taken 
together, CAP inhibited the growth of MCF-7/TxR cancer cells and recovered Tx
sensitivity by resetting the expression of multiple drug resistance-related
genes. These findings may contribute to extending the application of CAP to the
treatment of TxR cancer.
