BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is known to be the most common malignancy in
females whereas colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence also higher in both genders in 
Sri Lanka. TP53 is an important tumour suppressor gene and its somatic mutations 
are reported in approximately 27% of BC and 43% of CRC cases. Analysis of TP53
gene variants not only provides clues for the aetiology of the tumour formation, 
but also has an impact on treatment efficacy. The current study was conducted to 
investigate the pattern of TP53 variants in patients with BC and CRC from Sri
Lanka.
METHODS: 30 patients with BC, 21 patients with CRC and an equal number of healthy
controls were screened for mutational status of TP53 by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) followed by direct sequencing. In addition, a subset of these samples were 
analysed for the protein expression of p53 and comparison made with the
mutational status of TP53. We also analysed the protein expression of p21 and
MDM2 as potential indicators of p53 functional status and compared it with the
protein expression of p53. Additionally, hotspot codons of the KRAS, BRAF and
PIK3CA genes were also analysed in a subset of CRC patients.
RESULTS: Twenty seven sequence variants, including several novel variants in the 
TP53 gene were found. Nine BC and seven CRC tumour samples carried pathogenic
TP53 variants. Pathogenic point missense variants were associated with strong and
diffuse positive staining for p53 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), whereas, wild
type TP53 showed complete absence of positive IHC staining or rare positive
cells, regardless of the type of cancer. There was no direct correlation between 
p21 or MDM2 expression and p53 expression in either BCs or CRCs. Four of the CRC 
patients had pathogenic hotspot variants in KRAS; three of them were on codon 12 
and one was on codon 61.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of pathogenic somatic TP53 variants was 31 and 33.33% 
in the studied BC and CRC cohorts respectively. All of them were located in exons
5-8 and the pathogenic missense variants were associated with strong
immuno-positive staining for p53.
