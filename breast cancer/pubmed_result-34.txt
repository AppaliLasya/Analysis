BACKGROUNDS: HER-2 positive breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer with poor
clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) for HER-2 positive breast cancer and elucidate the potential
interactions among them.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three gene expression profiles (GSE29431, GSE45827, and
GSE65194) were derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GEO2R
tool was applied to obtain DEGs between HER-2 positive breast cancer and normal
breast tissues. Gene ontology (GO) annotation analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was performed by the Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (David) online tool.
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, hub gene identification and module
analysis was conducted by Cytoscape software. Online Kaplan-Meier plotter
survival analysis tool was also used to investigate the prognostic values of hub 
genes in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients.
RESULTS: A total of 54 upregulated DEGs and 269 downregulated DEGs were
identified. Among them, 10 hub genes including CCNB1, RAC1, TOP2A, KIF20A, RRM2, 
ASPM, NUSAP1, BIRC5, BUB1B, and CEP55 demonstrated by connectivity degree in the 
PPI network were screened out. In Kaplan-Meier plotter survival analysis, the
overexpression of RAC1 and RRM2 were shown to be associated with an unfavorable
prognosis in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This present study identified a number of potential target genes and
pathways which might impact the oncogenesis and progression of HER-2 positive
breast cancer. These findings could provide new insights into the detection of
novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for this disease.
