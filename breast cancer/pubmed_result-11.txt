Genetic testing for BRCA1/2 mutations has become the standard clinical practice. 
Recent findings suggest the clinical significance of multigene panel testing of
BRCA1/2 and other cancer-related genes. However, the clinical features of
patients with breast cancer with germline mutations identified using multigene
panels remain unclear. In this study, DNA samples from 583 Chinese women with
breast cancer were subjected to target sequencing for 54 cancer-related genes
using a pre-capture pooling method followed by next-generation sequencing. We
identified 79 pathogenic germline mutations in 21 cancer-related genes.
Forty-five patients (7.7%) harbored BRCA1/2 mutations, and 38 patients (6.5%)
carried pathogenic mutations in the remaining 19 genes. PALB2 was the most
commonly (1.2%) mutated gene other than BRCA1/2. Most of the identified
pathogenic mutations were novel, suggesting mutation screening by using multigene
panel testing is important particularly for non-European populations. Mutations
in BRCA1/2 and the other cancer-related genes were differentially associated with
clinical features. BRCA1 mutation carriers were strongly associated with
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), whereas BRCA2 mutation carriers were not.
Tumors in BRCA1-mutation carriers had a high histological grade. Patients with
BRCA2-mutated breast cancers were likely to develop E-cadherin-negative tumors
with bone metastases. Furthermore, mutations in PALB2 were strongly associated
with TNBC. We demonstrated the usefulness of multigene panel testing and observed
that a substantial proportion of patients with breast cancer had hereditary risk 
factors. Identifying differential associations between mutation status and
clinical features will advance our understanding regarding the pathologies of
this heterogeneous disease.
