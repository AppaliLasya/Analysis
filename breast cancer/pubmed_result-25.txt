Down-regulation of stemness genes expression is important in differentiation
therapy against cancer stem cells (CSCs). The aim of this study was to evaluate
the Oct4 , Sox2, Nanog, and C-myc expression in rat breast cancer stem cells
(LA7) which treated with human ovarian follicular fluid (FF), replicative
senescent fibroblast culture supernatant (P14), and 16 h serum starved fibroblast
supernatant (16 h-SFS). The cells were exposed to these biological fluids for
24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. Stem-loop RT-qPCR assay was used to quantify the
expression of above mentioned genes. Results showed that FF had the least
cytotoxic effect on the LA7 cells. Except for Nanog gene, exposure of LA7 cell
line to 16 h-SFS and P14 decreased significantly expression of the three other
genes after 24 h (P < 0.05). Nanog and Sox2 genes expression was also decreased
in LA7 cells which have been already treated with FF for 24 h. Moreover, compared
to the control solution, the expression of Oct4 increased significantly after
7 days exposure to FF (P < 0.05). Annexin V-PE /7-AAD-, acridine orange/ethidium 
bromide staining and doubling time assays revealed apoptosis and necrosis
induction by these biological fluids in LA7 cells. Moreover, in an in vitro model
of metastasis assay, i.e., scratch test, these fluids exhibited anti-LA7
migration activity which culminated in 16 h-SFS treated cells. Generally, this
study showed that FF, 16 h-SFS, and P14 have positive effects on down-regulation 
of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and C-myc expression, and consequently can increase the
differentiation of breast cancer stem cells. For the first time, this study
provided some evidence indicating that some biological fluids have potential to
differentiate the CSCs, show anti- survival, growth-, and cell migration
activity.
