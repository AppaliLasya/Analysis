Retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells is
associated with more than a tenfold induction of total Alzheimer's disease beta
A4 amyloid protein precursor (APP) mRNA as analyzed by Northern blot
hybridisation. S1 nuclease protection experiments reveal that the splicing
pattern of these differentiated cells is altered in favor of APP695 mRNA, coding 
for the shortest amyloidogenic beta A4 amyloid precursor protein. Induction of
differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells with NGF leads to a fivefold increase of total
APP mRNA without change in the splicing pattern. This suggests that RA but not
NGF induces factor(s) which are responsible for an APP hnRNA splicing favoring
APP695 mRNA.
