INTRODUCTION: Mutations in the gene for presenilin 1 (PSEN-1) cause familial,
early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). Diagnosis of EOAD is often a challenge
because of the high frequency of atypical presentations. Clinical manifestation
of EOAD may vary depending on underlying mutation; specific genetic mutations
influence development of specific clinical phenotypes; however, intrafamilial
phenotypic heterogeneity has also been noted in some pedigrees.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 36-year-old woman presenting with
progressive behavioral disturbances, dementia, involuntary movements, pyramidal
signs, epilepsy, and a family history of early-onset dementia accompanied by
involuntary movements. On genetic testing, the mutation at codon 424 (Leu→Arg) in
PSEN-1 gene was identified.
CONCLUSION: Our case describes a new phenotype of a known mutation of PSEN-1 at
codon 424.
