Although mitochondrial dysfunction is a consistent feature of Alzheimer's disease
in the brain and blood, the molecular mechanisms behind these phenomena are
unknown. Here we have replicated our previous findings demonstrating reduced
expression of nuclear-encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits and
subunits required for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS genes in
blood from people with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
Interestingly this was accompanied by increased expression of some
mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS genes, namely those residing closest to the
transcription start site of the polycistronic heavy chain mitochondrial
transcript (MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ATP6, MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-C03) and MT-ND6
transcribed from the light chain. Further we show that mitochondrial DNA copy
number was unchanged suggesting no change in steady-state numbers of
mitochondria. We suggest that an imbalance in nuclear and mitochondrial
genome-encoded OXPHOS transcripts may drive a negative feedback loop reducing
mitochondrial translation and compromising OXPHOS efficiency, which is likely to 
generate damaging reactive oxygen species.
