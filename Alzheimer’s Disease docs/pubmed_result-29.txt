Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the massive 
and invariant accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brains of affected patients.
In many cases Alzheimer's disease occurs in the absence of a prior history of the
disease in other family members and is designated as sporadic, whereas in
approximately 10% of patients, dominantly transmitted mutations within one of
three genes are found. A few mutations have been identified within the gene
encoding the beta-amyloid precursor protein; however, these mutations account for
only about 1-3% of cases with familial Alzheimer's disease. In the majority of
autosomal dominant cases (40-50%), mutations have been found in a gene localized 
to chromosome 14. The responsible gene, now called presenilin-1, has recently
been identified and shown to encode a putative seven transmembrane domain
protein. Surprisingly, a second highly homologous gene (named presenilin-2) was
cloned shortly thereafter. It is localized on human chromosome 1 and is also
involved in a small number of cases with familial Alzheimer's disease. Early data
suggest that mutations found within the two genes cause early onset Alzheimer's
disease by influencing the proteolytic processing of amyloid beta-peptide in a
pathological manner.
