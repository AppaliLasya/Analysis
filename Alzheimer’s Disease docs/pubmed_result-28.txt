We carried out an association study of transmembrane protein 106B gene (TMEM106B)
rs1020004 A/G, rs6966915C/T, and rs1990622 A/G in a population of 656 patients
with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 619 controls, and tested whether the rs1990622 
influences plasma progranulin levels. No differences in allele and genotype
distribution were observed between cases and controls, even stratifying according
to APOE status (p > 0.05). No differences in progranulin plasma levels were found
between carriers of the rs1990622 and non-carriers. TMEM106b variability does not
influence AD risk or plasma levels. Replication, preferably in a population with 
pathological confirmation, is required to confirm these results.
