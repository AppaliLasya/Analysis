Accumulating evidence suggests that genetic variants in the SORL1 gene are
associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), but a strategy to identify which variants
are pathogenic is lacking. In a discovery sample of 115 SORL1 variants detected
in 1908 Dutch AD cases and controls, we identified the variant characteristics
associated with SORL1 variant pathogenicity. Findings were replicated in an
independent sample of 103 SORL1 variants detected in 3193 AD cases and controls. 
In a combined sample of the discovery and replication samples, comprising 181
unique SORL1 variants, we developed a strategy to classify SORL1 variants into
five subtypes ranging from pathogenic to benign. We tested this pathogenicity
screen in SORL1 variants reported in two independent published studies. SORL1
variant pathogenicity is defined by the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion
(CADD) score and the minor allele frequency (MAF) reported by the Exome
Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database. Variants predicted strongly damaging
(CADD score >30), which are extremely rare (ExAC-MAF <1 × 10-5) increased AD risk
by 12-fold (95% CI 4.2-34.3; P=5 × 10-9). Protein-truncating SORL1 mutations were
all unknown to ExAC and occurred exclusively in AD cases. More common SORL1
variants (ExAC-MAF≥1 × 10-5) were not associated with increased AD risk, even
when predicted strongly damaging. Findings were independent of gender and the
APOE-ɛ4 allele. High-risk SORL1 variants were observed in a substantial
proportion of the AD cases analyzed (2%). Based on their effect size, we propose 
to consider high-risk SORL1 variants next to variants in APOE, PSEN1, PSEN2 and
APP for personalized risk assessments in clinical practice.
