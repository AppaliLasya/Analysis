Two recent studies have identified that a rare coding variant (p.R47H) in exon 2 
of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene is associated
with Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility in Caucasians. This association was 
not successfully replicated in Han Chinese, where this variant was rare or even
absent. Previously, we resequenced TREM2 exon 2 to investigate whether additional
rare variants conferred risk to AD in our cohort. Although several new variants
had been identified, none of them was significantly associated with disease
susceptibility. Here, to test whether TREM2 is truly a susceptibility gene of AD 
in Han Chinese, we extend our previous study by sequencing the other four exons
of TREM2 in 988 AD patients and 1,354 healthy controls. We provided the first
evidence that a rare coding variant (p.H157Y) in TREM2 exon 3 conferred a
considerable risk of AD in our cohort (Pcorrected = 0.02, odds ratio = 11.01, 95%
confidence interval: 1.38-88.05). This finding indicates that rare coding
variants of TREM2 may play an important role in AD in Han Chinese.
