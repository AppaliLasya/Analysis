BACKGROUND: The rate of occurrence of Alzheimer's disease is increasing around
the world. However, there is still no significant breakthrough in the study of
its etiology and pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To screen Alzheimer's disease pathogenic genes, which may be conducive
to the elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease And
predict the pathogenicity by various computer software.
METHODS: Clinical and neuroimaging examination, Whole Exome Sequencing, and
Sanger sequencing were performed in the proband. Mutation sites were verified in 
158 subjects.
RESULTS: We reported a proband carrying a probably novel pathogenic mutation,
which clinically manifests as progressive memory loss, visual-spatial disorders, 
apraxia, psychobehavioral disorders, and temperamental and personality changes.
Whole Exome Sequencing detected a novel missense mutation at codon 222 (Q222L),
which is a heterozygous A to T point mutation at position 665 (c.665A>T) in exon 
5 of the presenilin 1 leading to a glutamine-to-leucine substitution. The
mutation was also identified by Sanger sequencing in one family member;
nevertheless, it was not detected in the other 7 unaffected family members, 50
sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients and 100 control subjects.
CONCLUSION: A novel mutation in exon 5 of the presenilin 1 gene (Gln222Leu) in a 
Chinese family with early-onset Alzheimer's disease has been reported, besides，
it was predicted that the missense mutation was probably a novel pathogenic
mutation that was reported for the first time in a Chinese family with
early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
