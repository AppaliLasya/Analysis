The translation of promising preclinical treatments into effective drugs for
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been challenging. One of the most potent risk
factors for sporadic AD is carrier status of the epsilon 4 allele of the
apolipoprotein E gene (E4). E4 carriers show a differential response to several
therapies which are being investigated as AD treatments, including
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and therapeutics with vascular and metabolic
targets. The differential treatment responses of E4 carriers may partially
explain why some treatments show a null effect in clinical trials. Understanding 
the reasons behind these responses is not only important for clinical practice,
but may also help us elucidate mechanisms for this neurodegenerative disease.
