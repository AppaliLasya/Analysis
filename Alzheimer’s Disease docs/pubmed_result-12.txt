A novel mutation, a C to T transition at base pair 2124 in exon 17 of the amyloid
beta-protein precursor (APP) gene, has been identified by direct sequencing of
amplified DNA from two Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A simple
oligonucleotide-hybridization procedure was developed to allow population studies
of this DNA variation. The mutation, which is silent at the protein level, was
present in 2 out of 12 investigated AD patients, in 1 out of 60 non-AD patients
and in 1 out of 30 healthy individuals. The mutation can be used as a new marker 
for linkage studies involving the APP gene, although more comprehensive
population studies are required to determine the status of the mutation as a
possible risk factor for the development of AD.
