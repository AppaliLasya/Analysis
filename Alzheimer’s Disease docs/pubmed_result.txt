Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has dramatically influenced the field
of omics studies, such as genomics and transcriptomics. It is now possible to
access a significant number of previously known and novel genomic variants
through NGS. Although the effective manipulation and accurate interpretation of
the inordinate amount of data may pose a considerable challenge, it enables us to
identify specific genes responsible for causing or influencing the susceptibility
to a plethora of diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common etiology
of dementia in the elderly (approximately 60-70%). The current research trend of 
AD genetics focuses on the analysis of rare variants (allelic frequency <1%)
instead of common variants (allelic frequency >1%) to identify AD-associated
genes/variants. A number of genes (such as TREM2, ABCA7, SORL1) that carry rare
pathogenic variants have reportedly conferred susceptibility to AD with stronger 
genetic risk effects (odds ratio >2.0). Here, we are going to introduce a small
part of the latest many attractive findings about AD genetic researches.
