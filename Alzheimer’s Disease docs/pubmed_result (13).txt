Rare variation in TREM2 has been associated with greater risk for Alzheimer's
disease (AD). TREM2 encodes a cell surface receptor expressed on microglia and
related cells, and the R47H variant associated with AD appears to affect the
ability of TREM2 to bind extracellular ligands. In addition, other rare TREM2
mutations causing early-onset neurodegeneration are thought to impair cell
surface expression. Using a sequence kernel association (SKAT) analysis in two
independent AD cohorts, we found significant enrichment of rare TREM2 variants
not previously characterized at the protein level. Heterologous expression of the
identified variants showed that novel variants S31F and R47C displayed
significantly reduced cell surface expression. In addition, we identified rare
variant R136Q in a patient with language-predominant AD that also showed impaired
surface expression. The results suggest rare TREM2 variants enriched in AD may be
associated with altered TREM2 function and that AD risk may be conferred, in
part, from altered TREM2 surface expression.
