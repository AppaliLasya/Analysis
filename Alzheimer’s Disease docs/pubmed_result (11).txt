The SORL1 gene encodes a protein involved in the amyloidogenic process, and its
variants have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) physiopathology. We
screened for SORL1 variants in 124 familial (44 early- and 80 late-onset)
dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) cases. Nine potentially pathogenic changes
(three not previously reported and six rare variants) were found in nine probands
(7%). After screening the control population and siblings (presence in at least
1/200 controls and/or absence of segregation pattern), a causal relationship with
the disease was considered unlikely in six variants and uncertain in one. The
change Trp848Ter and a splice-site variant remained likely correlated with the
disease. SORL1 mutations are present in 7% of our familial DAT cohort, though in 
most cases cannot be considered the direct cause of the disease.
