The purpose was to compare longitudinal cognitive changes in APP and PSEN1 gene
mutation carriers and noncarriers from four autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's
disease (ADAD) families across preclinical and early clinical stages of disease. 
Carriers (n = 34) with four different mutations (PSEN1M146V, PSEN1H163Y, APPSWE, 
and APPARC) and noncarriers (n = 41) were followed up longitudinally with
repeated cognitive assessments starting many years before the expected clinical
onset. The relationship between cognition and years to expected clinical onset,
education, age, and type of mutation was analyzed using mixed-effects models.
Results showed an education-dependent and time-related cognitive decline with
linear and quadratic predictors in mutation carriers. Cognitive decline began
close to the expected clinical onset and was relatively rapid afterward in PSEN1 
mutation carriers, whereas decline was slower and started earlier than 10 years
before expected clinical onset in APP mutation carriers. In noncarriers, the
decline was minimal across time in accordance with normal aging. These results
suggest that phenotypes for onset and rate of cognitive decline vary with PSEN1
and APP genes, suggesting a behavioral heterogeneity in ADAD.
