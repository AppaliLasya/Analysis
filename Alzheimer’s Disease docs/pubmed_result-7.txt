The promoter of the gene for the precursor of Alzheimer's Disease A4 amyloid
protein (PAD gene) resembles promoters of housekeeping genes. A typical TATA box 
is missing, and transcription initiates at multiple sites. It shows a high GC
content of 72% in a DNA region that confers promoter activity to a reporter gene 
in vivo. Upstream of the RNA start sites we found sequences homologous to the
consensus binding sites of transcription factor AP-1 and the heat shock control
element binding protein. Six copies of a 9bp long GC-rich element are located
between positions -100 and -200 of the sequence. A protein-DNA interaction could 
be mapped to this element. The ratio of the dinucleotide CpG, the target for DNA 
methylation, versus GpC is about 1:1 around the RNA start site, in contrast to
the normal ratio of 1:5 in eucaryotic DNA. These findings suggest that four
mechanisms may participate in the regulation of the PAD gene: the stress-related 
heat shock; the AP-1/Fos binding; the GC-rich element, and the possible
methylation of the CpG region. PAD gene regulation could be of relevance for the 
progression of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's Disease.
