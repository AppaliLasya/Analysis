We studied neuropathologically 3 patients of a previously unreported kindred of
presenile Alzheimer disease (AD), characterized by a G to T mutation at base pair
1924 (695 transcript) of the amyloid precursor protein gene. Classic features of 
presenile AD are observed. Neurofibrillary tangles with paired helical filaments 
as well as neuritic plaques are found in large number in neocortex and
hippocampus. beta-Protein deposits in meningeal and parenchymal vessels are
present, but not severe. Prominent subpial ribbon-like deposits are detected with
antibodies to a 28-residue synthetic peptide; however, only occasionally can they
be seen in thioflavin S treated sections. Along with a mild involvement of
vessels, as demonstrated by beta-protein immunolabeling, parenchymal involvement 
is also seen in the cerebellar molecular layer. In the course of the study, we
have not detected neuropathologic changes, which are mutation specific. Further
investigations of familial Alzheimer disease with known genetic mutations will
clarify whether correlations exist between specific mutations and neuropathologic
phenotypes.
