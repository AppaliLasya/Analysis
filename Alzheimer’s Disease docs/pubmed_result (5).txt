The sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) gene has been associated with increased
risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rare genetic variants in the SORL1 gene have
also been implicated in autosomal dominant early-onset AD (EOAD). Here we report 
a large-scale investigation of the contribution of genetic variability in SORL1
to EOAD in a European EOAD cohort. We performed massive parallel amplicon-based
re-sequencing of the full coding region of SORL1 in 1255 EOAD patients and 1938
age- and origin-matched control individuals in the context of the European
Early-Onset Dementia (EOD) consortium, originating from Belgium, Spain, Portugal,
Italy, Sweden, Germany, and Czech Republic. We identified six frameshift variants
and two nonsense variants that were exclusively present in patients. These
mutations are predicted to result in haploinsufficiency through nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay, which could be confirmed experimentally for SORL1 p.Gly447Argfs*22
observed in a Belgian EOAD patient. We observed a 1.5-fold enrichment of rare
non-synonymous variants in patients (carrier frequency 8.8 %; SkatOMeta p value
0.0001). Of the 84 non-synonymous rare variants detected in the full
patient/control cohort, 36 were only detected in patients. Our findings
underscore a role of rare SORL1 variants in EOAD, but also show a non-negligible 
frequency of these variants in healthy individuals, necessitating the need for
pathogenicity assays. Premature stop codons due to frameshift and nonsense
variants, have so far exclusively been found in patients, and their predicted
mode of action corresponds with evidence from in vitro functional studies of
SORL1 in AD.
