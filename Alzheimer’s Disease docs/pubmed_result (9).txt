SORL1 gene variants were described as risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
additionally SORL1 gene variants were associated with altered Abeta(42) CSF
levels in AD patients. In the present study we investigated the association of
SORL1 gene variants (rs2070045 (SNP19), SORL1-18ex26 (SNP21), rs3824968 (SNP23), 
rs1010159 (SNP25)) with AD risk by using Cox proportional hazard model and
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in 349 AD patients and 483 controls, recruited
from a multicenter study of the German Competence Network Dementias. The
SNP21G-allele and a SORL1 haplotype consisting of the SNP19 T-allele, SNP21
G-allele and SNP23 A-allele (T/G/A) were associated with increased hazard ratios 
and an earlier age at onset of AD (SNP21: p=0.002; T/G/A haplotype: p=0.007).
This effect was most pronounced in carriers of an additional APOE4 allele (SNP21:
p=0.003; T/G/A haplotype: p=0.005). In conclusion, we found SORL1 gene variants
located in the 3' region of the gene to be associated with increased AD risk and 
an earlier age at onset of AD in our Central-European population. Thus, our data 
support a role of SORL1 polymorphisms in AD.
