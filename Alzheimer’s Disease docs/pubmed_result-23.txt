Both common and rare polymorphisms within ABCA7 have been associated with
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, the rare AD associated polymorphism
rs200538373 was associated with altered ABCA7 exon 41 splicing and an AD risk
odds ratio of âˆ¼1.9. To probe the role of this polymorphism in ABCA7 splicing, we 
used minigene studies and qPCR of human brain RNA. We report aberrant ABCA7 exon 
41 splicing in the brain of a carrier of the rs200538373 minor C allele.
Moreover, minigene studies show that rs200538373 acts as a robust functional
variant in vitro. Lastly, although the ABCA7 isoform with an extended exon 41 is 
predicted to undergo nonsense mediated RNA decay, this was not supported by qPCR 
analyses, which showed relatively normal ABCA7 mRNA levels in the carrier of the 
rs200538373 minor C allele. In summary, rs200538373 is a functional polymorphism 
that alters ABCA7 exon 41 splicing without grossly altering the level of ABCA7
mRNA.
