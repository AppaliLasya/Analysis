Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and
extracellular amyloid-β plaques (Aβ). Despite ongoing research, some ambiguity
remains surrounding the role of Aβ in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative 
disease. While several studies have focused on the mutations associated with AD, 
our understanding of the epigenetic contributions to the disease remains less
clear. To that end, we determined the changes in DNA methylation in
differentiated human neurons with and without Aβ treatment. DNA was isolated from
neurons treated with Aβ or vehicle, and the two samples were digested with either
a methylation-sensitive (HpaII) or a methylation-insensitive (MspI) restriction
endonuclease. The fragments were amplified and co-hybridized to a commercial
promoter microarray. Data analysis revealed a subset of genomic loci that shows a
significant change in DNA methylation following Aβ treatment in comparison to the
control group. After mapping these loci to nearby genes, we discovered high
enrichment for cell-fate genes that control apoptosis and neuronal
differentiation. Finally, we incorporated three of those genes in a possible
model suggesting the means by which Aβ contributes to the brain shrinkage and
memory loss seen in AD.
