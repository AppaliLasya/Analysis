Beta amyloid gene duplication in Alzheimer's disease and karyotypically normal
Down syndrome.

With the recently cloned complementary DNA probe, lambda Am4 for the chromosome
21 gene encoding brain amyloid polypeptide (beta amyloid protein) of Alzheimer's 
disease, leukocyte DNA from three patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease and 
two patients with karyotypically normal Down syndrome was found to contain three 
copies of this gene. Because a small region of chromosome 21 containing the ets-2
gene is duplicated in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as in
karyotypically normal Down syndrome, duplication of a subsection of the critical 
segment of chromosome 21 that is duplicated in Down syndrome may be the genetic
defect in Alzheimer's disease.
