BACKGROUND: CRTC1 (CREB regulated transcription coactivator 1) gene plays a role 
in synaptic plasticity, learning and long-term memory formation in the
hippocampus. Recently, CRTC1 has been shown to be downregulated in Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying CRTC1 dysregulation in AD
remain unclear.
METHODS: To understand better the epigenetic mechanisms regulating CRTC1
expression that may be altered in AD, we profiled DNA methylation at CpG site
resolution by bisulfite cloning sequencing in two promoter regions (referred to
as Prom1 and Prom2) of the CRTC1 gene in human hippocampus from controls and AD
cases. Next, we correlated DNA methylation levels with AD-related pathology,
i.e., β-amyloid and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) burden and also measured CRTC1
mRNA levels by RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: Methylation levels were lower in AD cases as compared to controls within
both promoter regions (Prom1: 0.95% vs. 5%, p-value < 0.01 and Prom2: 2.80% vs.
17.80%, p-value < 0.001). Interestingly, CRTC1 methylation levels inversely
correlated with AD-related neuropathological changes, particularly with p-tau
deposition (rSpearman = -0.903, p < 0.001). Moreover, a 1.54-fold decrease in
CRTC1 mRNA levels was observed in hippocampus of AD cases compared to controls
(p < 0.05) supporting the notion that CRTC1 is downregulated in the AD
hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation levels within two distinct promoter regions of the
CRTC1 gene were decreased in human hippocampus affected by AD compared with
controls and methylation within Prom1 showed a strong inverse correlation with
p-tau deposition. Further studies are guaranteed to elucidate the precise role
that CRTC1 methylation plays in AD pathophysiology.
