The genetic variants play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD), while the relationships of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) with AD are still controversial. We performed the meta-analysis to obtain 
a more precise estimation of whether growth factor receptor-bound
protein-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2), phosphatidylinositol binding
clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1)
variants are associated with AD. Databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane
Library were searched to find relevant studies. Cochran's Q-statistic and I 2
were used to assess the heterogeneity among the included studies. Odds ratios
(OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were conducted to evaluate the
association between the SNP and the susceptibility to AD. Publication bias was
estimated by funnel plots. All of the statistical analyses were implemented using
R Version 3.2.1 software. A total of 35 case-control studies involving 15 SNPs
were included. There was no significant association between SNPs of GAB2
rs2373115 (G > T) and PICALM rs541458 (C > T) and AD. The allele T of rs3851179
in PICALM was associated with a 13 % increase in the risk of AD. Seven SNPs on
SORL1 were significantly associated with AD. Four SNPs, including rs1010159*T,
rs641120*A, rs668387*T, and rs689021*A, were associated with a decreased risk of 
AD, while the other three SNPs, including rs12285364*T, rs2070045*G, and
rs2282649*T, were all associated with an increased risk of AD. The results of the
present study suggested that multiple gene variants were associated with AD. The 
SNP of rs3851179 (PICALM), rs12285364 (SORL1), rs2070045 (SORL1), and rs2282649
(SORL1) was associated with an increased risk of AD, whereas SORL1 rs1010159,
rs641120, rs668387, and rs689021 were associated with a decreased risk of AD.
